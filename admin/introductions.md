## Funding the Commons TG introduction
Hey folks! 

We’re building a free open-source framework that helps communities determine the relative value of all contributions, including evaluations themselves, enabling automated rewards and cross-community coordination through interoperable metrics. 🌱

We’ve proven the concept across diverse use cases and communities, including the recent FtC Design Jam in Bangkok: https://youtu.be/88G-iU-wIP8?si=fNHzX0Cm3O7NNxfP&t=3096 

Currently building an MVP and seeking a front end developer to join the team (React & NextJS). We will be rewarding contributors retrospectively, via the same framework we’re creating, but as this is an ongoing experiment and funding is limited, would suit someone who can contribute freely without need for immediate return. 

See links for more info, and please feel free to reach out with any feedback or questions 🙏

## CHAOSS Slack introduction
Hey folks! @Rowland Mosbergen suggested I join here as we’re developing a project that may be of service to the CHAOSS mission.
We’re researching and developing an open source system that can estimate the relative value of literally any contribution, using an inclusive peer-evaluation process that motivates engagement through direct rewards, including rewards for evaluations themselves.

The key innovation is in pegging valuation metrics to the valuation process itself, which produces standardised, interoperable metrics that can foster coordination between diverse communities. We’ve prototyped successfully in a range of communities spanning the arts, science and tech sectors, and now building an MVP to scale. Seeking aligned developers to collaborate with and test when ready (particularly frontend support right now).

Please see our Readme and Wiki for more info, and I welcome any feedback :pray: (our website may or may not work — currently having issues)
I’d also love to share more and connect, and wondering the best way to do this. I noticed you have weekly meetings, would it be appropriate to present at one of those in coming weeks?


## DeSci London TG intro
Hey all,

I’m Coops, former architect and neuroscientist-turned-open science entrepreneur after discovering academia is broken.

Main focus now is MetaValuation, a novel mechanism aiming to overcome collective inaction and kickstart a virtuous cycle across multiple sectors of society. 

It leverages a simple open evaluation protocol that leads to automatic rewards for all contributions, including evaluations themselves, thus aligning incentives and enabling decentralized coordination through interoperable metrics.

We’ve proven the model in diverse contexts (science, art, tech) and now building an MVP to scale. Expecting to launch at the Metascience conference in London end of June and thought it could be cool to link up with this community before then :) 

It’s a collaborative effort and open to support, particularly on data analysis, UX and frontend. Please reach out if interested! 🙏

Looking forward to finding out more about what you’re all up to 🥰



## To a known developer
We’re building a collective valuation system, which can take any contribution as input--ideas, actions, resources-- and determine its relative value in standard units. The evaluation mechanism is super simple so that the whole community can participate, and is also directly rewarded, incentivising engagement with the system. 

We’ve prototyped with 5 science, tech, and arts communities, generating interoperable metrics and proving the concept for mass coordination at scale. 

Current focus is the MVP, just a Web2 implementation so we can collect bulk data and understand dynamics before putting on chain. We’ve got a really solid international team, meeting weekly, but could use one more person on front end. 

Our goal is to use the MVP to value contributions and reward contributors retrospectively from the $20k funds in our charity, but as it’s all experimental seeking people who can give without short term financial needs. 

Keen to hear your thoughts :)

## To a known developer who said they are open to hire
Ok cool. We’re not looking to hire out per se. 

To jog your memory, we’re building an open source platform that determines fair value for any contribution, enabling automated rewards to contributors.

We have some seed funding in our charity, but not using it to pay people directly. Instead we’re all contributing in the ways we want to, then planning to use the app to value everyone’s contributions and distribute funds accordingly.

This should demonstrate the virtuous cycle of our model and incentivise more donations, but it’s all experimental and can’t make any promises. 

So if you’re needing short term guarantees then this isn’t for you. But if you’re willing to give freely and trust in the process, then I believe it will be a net win for everyone long term. We’re all in the exact same boat for this one, and I feel you’d be a great addition to the crew. 

But no stress either way, I’m sure we will get there when the time is right 🙏 Let me know if you have any questions. 🥰


## To an old open science colleague
Hey XXX
Reaching out to loop you into a cool new initiative we're developing.

It's an open source valuation system, which can take any contribution as input--ideas, actions, resources-- and determine its relative value to the community in standard units. The hook is that evaluations themselves are recognised and rewarded, incentivising engagement and overcoming the slow adoption of open science alternatives we've seen previously. 

Yep, still trying to kickstart an open science revolution. But this time think we're really onto something. 

Would love to hear what you think, or arrange a call to discuss in detail. 

Also keen to hear about your journey and what you've been up to!

Cheers
Cooper

## Crecimiento TG intro
Hi all I’m Coops 🙂

Former architect and neuroscientist, now system designer and metaresearcher at openheartmind.org (OHM) 🌱

We’re building a free, open-source platform that lets any community determine the relative value of any contribution — ideas, actions, resources — with direct rewards in standardized units, so that we can empower contributors, incentivise public goods, and foster global coordination. 🚀

We’ve prototyped successfully in diverse contexts like festivals and conferences, now building an MVP to scale. We have a great dev team but open to support from anyone who’d like to help us release in time for Crecimiento, so we can test on site and empower the community. 🙏

Aside from that, I like yoga, meditation, rockclimbing, snowboarding, poker and other games. 🃏

I just discovered Crecimiento while at ZuGrama, India, so I’m excited to discover another aligned pop-up community and looking forward to applying 🥰



### ZuGrama Buildathon Github thread
Hey @nooblemon-eth thanks for asking! We're building over here.

Could use dev support on both frontend (React) and backend (Nest JS). @dipanshuhappy and @arrytiwari are working on the backend and frontend locally, respectively, so perhaps they can offer more details.

Our next team meeting is Tuesday 1pm, so if someone is interested we could onboard them before, then meet the rest of the team and assign tasks to do during the week.

Aside from coding, we could also use some support on data analysis and visualisation.


### ZuGrama TG intro
Hi all I’m Coops 🙂

I’m a designer, neuroscientist, and founder at openheartmind.org (OHM) 🌱

We’re building a free, open-source collective sensemaking platform to measure the relative value of diverse contributions, so we can empower public goods providers and help communities coordinate effectively. 




## IPFS Unconference Telegram channel intro (Nov 2024)
Hi I’m Cooper 👋 neuroscience PhD with 6+ years researching, developing and validating a decentralised collective valuation protocol that I think could be valuable for the IPFS ecosystem. Would love a vote on my proposal if you like the idea of a radically inclusive open peer review protocol with inbuilt incentive mechanism! 🥰

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xEZfejT43UtRjkUM9n_miPoxGlGbcrIbh0BmudSUiTo/edit?usp=sharing


We have a small but awesome volunteer team and will be building throughout ZuGrama— hoping to release an MVP by the end so reach out if you like the idea of kickstarting a gifting revolution and would like to help us reach this milestone. 😍

Aside from that, I like yoga, meditation, rockclimbing (doesn’t look like there’s any climbing gyms or crags in TRV?) and all kindsa gamezzz!

Deeply grateful to ZuGrama for having me and looking forward to meeting you all soon!
