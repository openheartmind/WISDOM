### To a known developer
We’re building a collective valuation system, which can take any contribution as input--ideas, actions, resources-- and determine its relative value in standard units. The evaluation mechanism is super simple so that the whole community can participate, and is also directly rewarded, incentivising engagement with the system. 

We’ve prototyped with 5 science, tech, and arts communities, generating interoperable metrics and proving the concept for mass coordination at scale. 

Current focus is the MVP, just a Web2 implementation so we can collect bulk data and understand dynamics before putting on chain. We’ve got a really solid international team, meeting weekly, but could use one more person on front end. 

Our goal is to use the MVP to value contributions and reward contributors retrospectively from the $20k funds in our charity, but as it’s all experimental seeking people who can give without short term financial needs. 

Keen to hear your thoughts :)

### To a known developer who asked about payment situation
Ok cool. We’re not looking to hire out per se. 

To jog your memory, we’re building an open source platform that determines fair value for any contribution, enabling automated rewards to contributors.

We have some seed funding in our charity, but not using it to pay people directly. Instead we’re all contributing in the ways we want to, then planning to use the app to value everyone’s contributions and distribute funds accordingly.

This should demonstrate the virtuous cycle of our model and incentivise more donations, but it’s all experimental and can’t make any promises. 

So if you’re needing short term guarantees then this isn’t for you. But if you’re willing to give freely and trust in the process, then I believe it will be a net win for everyone long term. We’re all in the exact same boat for this one, and I feel you’d be a great addition to the crew. 

But no stress either way, I’m sure we will get there when the time is right 🙏 Let me know if you have any questions. 🥰


### To a known open science coordinator
Hey XXX
Reaching out to loop you into a cool new initiative we're developing.

It's an open source valuation system, which can take any contribution as input--ideas, actions, resources-- and determine its relative value to the community in standard units. The hook is that evaluations themselves are recognised and rewarded, incentivising engagement and overcoming the slow adoption of open science alternatives we've seen previously. 

Yep, still trying to kickstart an open science revolution. But this time think we're really onto something. 

Would love to hear what you think, or arrange a call to discuss in detail. 

Also keen to hear about your journey and what you've been up to!

Cheers
Cooper

### Crecimiento TG intro
Hi all I’m Coops 🙂

Former architect and neuroscientist, now system designer and metaresearcher at openheartmind.org (OHM) 🌱

We’re building a free, open-source platform that lets any community determine the relative value of any contribution — ideas, actions, resources — with direct rewards in standardized units, so that we can empower contributors, incentivise public goods, and foster global coordination. 🚀

We’ve prototyped successfully in diverse contexts like festivals and conferences, now building an MVP to scale. We have a great dev team but open to support from anyone who’d like to help us release in time for Crecimiento, so we can test on site and empower the community. 🙏

Aside from that, I like yoga, meditation, rockclimbing, snowboarding, poker and other games. 🃏

I just discovered Crecimiento while at ZuGrama, India, so I’m excited to discover another aligned pop-up community and looking forward to applying 🥰


### ZuGrama TG intro
Hi all I’m Coops 🙂

I’m a designer, neuroscientist, and founder at openheartmind.org (OHM) 🌱

We’re building a free, open-source collective sensemaking platform to measure the relative value of diverse contributions, so we can empower public goods providers and help communities coordinate effectively. 

We have a small but awesome volunteer team and will be building throughout ZuGrama— hoping to release an MVP by the end so reach out if you like the idea of kickstarting a gifting revolution and would like to help us reach this milestone. 😍

Aside from that, I like yoga, meditation, rockclimbing (doesn’t look like there’s any climbing gyms or crags in TRV?) and all kindsa gamezzz!

Deeply grateful to ZuGrama for having me and looking forward to meeting you all soon!
