### Bio (150 words)
Dr Cooper Smout is a designer, researcher, and social entrepreneur dedicated to systemic change. Inspired by a Vipassana meditation retreat, he transitioned from a career in architecture to study psychology and neuroscience, earning awards for his Honours and PhD theses on the neural mechanisms of visual awareness.

After uncovering misaligned incentives in academia, Cooper shifted his focus to academic reform. He founded Free Our Knowledge, a collective action platform to advance open science practices. Insights from these campaigns informed the development of a novel open evaluation model. To prototype and validate the model, he established Open Heart + Mind, a citizen-science community and charity, applying it across both academic and non-academic contexts.

Cooper is passionate about collaboration and sustainability, envisioning a future where distributed networks of diverse communities share data and co-develop collaborative AI to tackle complex global challenges, such as climate change.

### Proposal
Title:
Metavaluation: An open, fair, and inclusive mechanism for valuing diverse scholarly contributions

Short abstract:
Metavaluation is an open source framework that empowers communities to assess and reward the value of diverse contributions, including evaluations, promoting engagement and fair credit. This talk will introduce the model, share data from multiple communities, and live demo the new Metavaluation app.

Description:
Metavaluation is a collective valuation framework designed to address academia’s collective action problem by directly rewarding contributions based on their relative value. It features pairwise comparisons as an inclusive evaluation mechanism, enabling communities to assess diverse contributions across multiple dimensions of interest. Its core innovation lies in the relative valuation of evaluations themselves (metavaluation), creating a self-reinforcing feedback loop that incentivizes high-quality evaluations and enables the automatic, standardized valuation of all contributions.

In this talk, I’ll outline the framework and its development, beginning as a scholarly publishing model and evolving through iterative experimentation into a generalizable solution for diverse communities. I’ll present data from various implementations across the arts, science, and technology sectors, demonstrating how Metavaluation can connect communities with common values and goals. I’ll then focus on an academic case study from an open science and metaresearch conference, highlighting how the framework (a) surfaced community values and hidden contributions, (b) incentivized peer evaluations, and (c) quantified contribution value across multiple dimensions.

I’ll present the results of multiple analyses, demonstrating how Metavaluation can foster a virtuous cycle by recognizing and rewarding critical system functions, including evaluations, metaresearch, and system improvements. Finally, I’ll provide a live demonstration of our new open-source Metavaluation app and invite attendees to participate in a collective experiment to value Metascience 2025 contributions, fostering fair recognition, informing future planning, and building a dynamic reward system for the community.

### Talk
Metavaluation: An open, fair, and inclusive mechanism for valuing diverse scholarly contributions

Metavaluation is a novel mechanism designed from first principles to overcome the collective action problem in academia by offering direct rewards for diverse contributions, including peer-reviews themselves. In this talk, I’ll give a brief overview of the framework, highlighting the key innovation: the use of pairwise comparisons as both an inclusive review protocol and a standard unit of value, serving to scale the relative value of all other contributions in a decentralised and autonomous manner. I’ll share data from several communities, within academia and beyond, as a testament to the models capacity to adapt to diverse contexts and foster coordination through interoperable metrics. I’ll close with a vision for how the model could connect diverse communities in the research space and beyond, fostering a virtuous cycle of value creation in line with the evolving needs and values of diverse research communities around the world.

### Hackathon
Metavaluation: Recognising and rewarding diverse contributions to SIPS

Metavaluation is a novel mechanism designed from first principles to address the collective action problem in academia by offering direct rewards for diverse contributions—including peer reviews. The Metavaluation app, developed by the Open Heart Mind (OHM) community, is a free, open-source tool created to demonstrate the model and make it accessible to a wide range of communities.

In this hackathon, participants will use the Metavaluation app to nominate SIPS contributions and determine their relative value through an inclusive peer-review process. Every participant will have the opportunity to vote for their preferred contributions and be rewarded for their input. By the end of the session, we will generate a set of multidimensional scores that reflect the unique qualities of each contribution—including the evaluations themselves. This dataset may serve as a replicable template for future investigations, potentially fostering a virtuous cycle of value creation within the SIPS community.

We will generate multidimensional scores for all nominated contributions and evaluations themselves, reflecting their relative value to the SIPS community.

Metavaluation is designed to foster diversity and inclusion by being accessible and adaptable to diverse populations within academia and beyond. It allows for the evaluation of the relative value of any contribution—whether an idea, action, or resource—ensuring that all contributors at SIPS are fairly recognized for their efforts. The protocol is simple and user-friendly, promoting broad participation and rewarding reviewers for their input. By aligning incentives between individuals, communities, and institutions, the framework creates a virtuous cycle of value creation that supports Open Science principles, ultimately strengthening psychological science.




## Giveth project description

We’re developing a free, open-source framework that any community can use to quantify the value of any contribution (e.g., ideas, actions, resources) in standard units, using an inclusive peer-review process, so that they can empower contributors, incentivise public goods and coordinate effectively. 

Our framework leverages "metavaluation", a novel mechanism designed from first principles to overcome network effects and motivate positive-sum voluntary coooperation. Metavaluation is:

simple and accessible to diverse populations
inclusive to diverse contribution types
automated beyond the peer-evaluation phase
interoperable between communities and with other mechanisms
a minimal framework that can evolve dynamically to suit the needs of diverse communities

We've prototyped successfully in various contexts (e.g., festivals, conferences, decentralised projects), and are now building an MVP to scale. Everything we do is guided by open science principles (e.g., transparency, sharing, inclusivity, fairness, reproducibility) and we record all contributions toward metavaluation, so that we can give fair credit to everyone who contributes (yes, we practice what we preach!).

## Astera Open Science Fellowship application cover letter (Dec 2024)
31st December 2024

Dear Members of the Fellowship Committee, 

Please find below my application for the Astera Open Science Fellowship. 

My background
I am a former architect and cognitive neuroscientist dedicated to academic reform. I founded Free Our Knowledge to coordinate grassroots collective action, then pivoted to design a collective valuation model based on my understanding of cultural blockers in academia. I founded Open Heart Mind to prototype in the safer context of gift-based festivals, then validated the model for academia by application to an open science conference and other community projects. We now have a proof-of-concept web app and MVP design artifacts, and are seeking support to scale.
A problem in communication among scientists
Open science efforts remain fragmented across siloed platforms, lacking interoperability. Meanwhile, academic metrics (citations, impact factor) overshadow essential contributions like code, data curation, and peer review—leaving them underrepresented. These misaligned incentives entrench the status quo, as researchers prioritise career-friendly outputs over collaborative practices. A unifying mechanism is needed to align incentives, diversify recognition, and foster coordination across communities.
Proposed solution (open to refinement with Astera)
WISDOM (Weighted Information System for Distributed Open Merit) is a multi-dimensional open science and meta-research framework that estimates the relative value of diverse ideas, actions, and resources in standard units. It adapts to variable use cases through the following core processes:
Contribution & Dimension Selection: The community nominates the contributions (e.g., papers, code, reviews) and multiple dimensions to assess (e.g., impact, creativity, rigor).
Pairwise Comparisons: Community members vote between randomly selected pairs of contributions (e.g., a piece of code vs. a software tool) on each dimension of interest.
Meta-Comparisons: Community members compare contribution pairs in which one “contribution” is a batch of generic or prior comparisons (e.g., 100 pairwise comparisons).
Autonomous Valuations: Open-source algorithms aggregate these comparisons into multidimensional scores for each contribution, with each dimension normalized to the relative value of a single pairwise comparison. Rewards are fast, fair, and stackable across communities, incentivising high-value contributions with broad impact (e.g., public goods).
Dynamic Adaptation: Open data and meta-research encourage continuous improvement, aligning metrics and processes with evolving community values, needs, and priorities.
Combined, these features create a virtuous cycle of value creation, aligning individual and collective incentives, empowering contributors, and fostering coordination through interoperable metrics.
The landscape of competitive products and services 
Existing solutions address fragments of the problem but fail to support a rich, dynamic research ecosystem, especially given researchers’ time constraints and entrenched incentives favoring traditional metrics.
Altmetrics (e.g., PlumX) go beyond citations but often track popularity over actual impact. 
Badges (e.g., Plaudit, COS) promote openness but are limited to binary judgements.
Crowd-review platforms (e.g., SciPost, Qeios, Octopus) rely on absolute ratings (e.g., 5-point star ratings), which are prone to gaming and bias (e.g., ceiling effects, availability).
Rubrics (e.g., in grant evaluations) improve rigor but aren’t scalable to diverse contributions.
Token-based platforms (e.g., ResearchHub, Gitcoin, Collaborape, DAOs) reward contributions but risk bias toward early adopters and technically adept users. 
In contrast, WISDOM offers a simple, inclusive, unified, and scalable framework that can be tailored to community values and use cases. Its novel meta-comparison process incentivizes quality feedback, enables fair and autonomous valuation, and fosters coordination via interoperable metrics.
Skills, team members and collaborations 
My expertise lies in design, data science, and community building. I have skill gaps in product management and software development, which are addressed by our volunteer development team. I anticipate adding team members to strengthen marketing and communications. I propose to dog-food WISDOM by distributing quarterly bounties through its metrics (see below), thereby incentivising contributions and refining the model as we scale.
Quarterly Milestones 
Q1: User research, MVP development, early outreach, announce bounties
Q2: Beta testing, gather feedback, refine platform, value Q1 and Q2 contributions & distribute Bounty Rounds 1 & 2
Q3: Launch platform, expand outreach, value Q3 contributions & distribute Bounty Round 3
Q4: Evaluate impact, publish findings, plan growth, value Q4 contributions & distribute Bounty Round 4
Budget (Total $410,000 proposed, though bounties can scale according to available funds)
Personnel: $150,000 (Project Lead)
Bounties (scalable): $150,000 ($10k Round 1, $20k Round 2, $40k Round 3, $80k Round 4)
Compute: $25,000 (Cloud services, data storage, computational resources)
Equipment: $15,000 (Development hardware)
Travel: $40,000 (On-site visits, conferences, community outreach)
Miscellaneous: $30,000 (e.g., marketing, legal fees, contingency)
Openness and Working Arrangement  
All code, data, and resources will be shared openly. I prefer a hybrid arrangement so I can develop collaborations on-site at Astera while remaining connected to globally distributed communities.
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind Regards, 

Cooper Smout, Ph.D






## ZuGrama Buildathon (Group code: NJzmFJRU) (Dec 2024)

#### Fast forward 10 years. What would you have achieved that you would consider impactful, either personally or for the world? How would you like ZuGrama to help you achieve this vision?
In 10 years, I envision WISDOM as a foundational framework for empowering the commons and fostering a thriving gifting economy. It will enable diverse communities to fairly evaluate contributions, share resources equitably, and make decisions rooted in collective expertise. ZuGrama could act as both a testing ground and exemplar, embedding its mission into WISDOM, optimizing for its values, and empowering contributors to drive equitable, values-aligned collaboration and resource sharing.

#### What is an area of technology or science that you believe is underexplored but holds immense potential for human flourishing? Describe how you would start investigating this area if you had unlimited resources.
Contemplative AI: training agents on value-aligned data to embody mindfulness and wisdom. With unlimited resources, I would fund diverse communities to record and value their activities via WISDOM, and also fund research into training AI on these datasets. I would create an autonomous, value-based grants program aimed at creating an interoperable network of wise, conscious AI, who can collaborate to solve complex problems while enhancing human flourishing and well-being.

#### Describe a complex problem you’ve worked on recently. How did you approach it, and what frameworks or methods did you use to break it down and find a solution? (Optional)
For the last 6+ years, I’ve been working on the collective action problem keeping researchers locked into traditional journals. Initially, I researched alternative models and built a collective action platform to motivate their support. Realizing this approach was too slow, I pivoted to design WISDOM from first principles and prototyped by hosting gift-based festivals. We then validated for academic use at open science conferences, demonstrating its potential for widespread systemic change.

#### What is the problem statement you want to work on? (Please write the problem statement (You can pick from exisiting list) or provide your own (but within these fields); Please describe your solution if you have one already.)

1. Impact-driven Funding – How can a decentralized funding system prioritize the impact and effectiveness of projects rather than relying solely on majority voting?
2. Community Utility Tokens – Develop a token framework that allows decentralized communities to manage shared resources and incentivize participation effectively
3. Governance Mechanisms – What governance structures can enable ZuGrama to scale effectively while maintaining its philoslophy?

WISDOM addresses these challenges by leveraging transparent, inclusive, community-driven valuation. It quantifies contribution value through controlled pairwise comparisons, prioritizing project impact over popularity. Pairwise comparisons, as the base unit of value, are rewarded immediately, fostering participation and enabling fair distribution of resources via tokens linked to contribution value. Reputation profiles track sustained value over time on community-defined dimensions, enabling scalable governance in line with core values.





## Max Impact with Jimi Grow (Nov 2024)
### What's your personal bio? 
Dr Cooper Smout is a designer, researcher and lifelong student of human behaviour. Inspired by a Vipassana meditation retreat, he left a promising career in architecture to study Psychology and Neuroscience at the University of Queensland, winning prizes for both his Honours and PhD theses in the neural mechanisms of visual awareness.

Cooper’s passion for good design found a counterpart in the scholarly publishing industry, igniting a new interest in Open Science and the problem of cultural change in academia. He founded the world’s first collective action platform for researchers (Free Our Knowledge) and spent several years campaigning for open and reproducible research practices, later drawing on these experiences to design a decentralized peer-review model with disruptive potential. Realising he could make faster progress outside of academia, he founded a citizen-science project (Open Heart + Mind) and prototyped by peer-reviewing contributions to community gatherings, before validating the model for use in academia by peer-reviewing contributions to Open Science conferences. 

Alongside these pursuits, Cooper enjoys playing games, snowboarding, rockclimbing, meditating, and dancing, and dreams of one day of belonging to a network of interconnected permaculture communities all coordinating their efforts to regenerate the planet.   

### Tell me a bit bout your company
Open Heart + Mind (OHM) is a volunteer organisation dedicated to exploring radical models for society based on Open Science principles of sharing, transparency, fairness, equity, diversity and inclusion. Since co-founding in 2022, we’ve partnered with a registered arts charity and co-created a diverse range of community gatherings, using each opportunity to prototype a new model of collective valuation through open peer-review of contributions. Through this collaborative process, OHM has developed WISDOM, an open source meta-research framework that empowers communities to collectively value their own contributions in standard units, on dimensions reflecting their values, so that they can reward contributors quickly and fairly, share resources effectively and coordinate with aligned organisations. We’ve prototyped this model successfully in a range of communities spanning the arts, science and technology sectors and are now building an MVP to scale the model to diverse communities around the world. Our first use case will be back-valuing all of the recorded contributions to OHM since we founded, including a $50k donation, so that we can recognise contributors with reputation metrics and reward them with a fair share of any spare resources available to the community. In doing so, we aim to test the theory that this will create a self-reinforcing feedback loop, or ‘virtuous cycle’, which can be replicated in diverse communities and facilitate coordination between aligned organisations. 





## Astera Residency application (Nov 2024)
### Describe the problem you expect your residency to focus on and your proposed solution or direction for identifying a solution. Aim for a level of explanation that a smart college freshman could understand. (3000 characters max)
The open science movement faces two critical challenges: coordination and adoption. Despite shared goals, efforts remain fragmented and underutilized, limiting their collective impact. For example, at least 37 preprint review platforms compete for limited resources, while remaining underutilized compared to journals. Similarly, most open science communities operate in near-isolation. These fragmented efforts could be more effectively united under a common recognition framework, but no existing system can efficiently determine the relative value of diverse contribution types across different platforms and communities.

WISDOM (Weighted Information Schema for Distributed Open Merit) addresses these challenges by providing a flexible framework for valuing diverse contributions with respect to common goals and values. The core protocol is simple and inclusive: community members choose between pairs of contributions on multiple dimensions of interest and are rewarded for each comparison with one unit of value. Votes are aggregated to produce multidimensional, crowd-level scores for each contribution, which are also awarded to contributors. By gamifying the experience with fun and fast rewards for all contribution types, WISDOM incentivises engagement in supported communities. 

WISDOM’s key innovation is using pairwise comparisons as a fundamental unit of value to scale all other contributions. This is achieved via meta-comparisons – embedding batches of comparisons into the process – then using algorithms to scale valuations. By generating standardized metrics pegged to a replicable process (pairwise comparisons), WISDOM helps communities determine fair contribution value and allocate resources effectively (e.g., via automated grants programs). By allowing diverse communities to recognise shared resources like public goods under the same framework, WISDOM allows individuals to stack rewards from multiple communities and thus incentivises the creation of public goods. 

During the residency, I propose to:
- Build open source infrastructure and integrate with key open science platforms
- Create standardized APIs enabling value and reputation transfer between projects
- Design and validate algorithms for generating reliable reputation metrics
- Conduct rigorous testing of scalability and resistance to gaming
- Prototype implementation in Web3 technologies

This will create a coordination layer enabling open science projects to:
- Measure progress toward goals with standardized metrics
- Highlight hidden contributions and reward contributors based on value created
- Share reviewer pools and reduce duplicated effort
- Transfer and aggregate reputation metrics across platforms 
- Generate empirical data about which approaches work best
- Cooperate effectively while maintaining independence

This will enable WISDOM to unite fragmented efforts toward a more cohesive open science movement. It may also have additional applications in other domains facing similar challenges.

### Why did you pick this problem to work on? What’s novel about it?
During my PhD, I became aware of misaligned academic incentives and realized my time would be best spent trying to disrupt the journal industry. I founded Free Our Knowledge (FOK) to coordinate the adoption of open peer-review platforms, concluding that (a) many projects were failing to coordinate, and (b) we needed direct rewards to incentivise reviews. I felt that both problems might be solvable if open peer-review could be standardized and expanded to cover project contributions and reviews themselves, and dedicated my time to solving this problem due to the high expected value, even with a marginal likelihood of success. 

This problem is novel in that it is fundamental to practically every sector of society. Open science is but one part of the broader global commons, to which it is intimately interconnected. Solving this problem could thus lead to knock-on effects in other sectors facing similar collective action problems, such as the environmental and cultural commons.
Why are you the right person to move your project forward?
My unconventional path has prepared me to develop WISDOM. I learned first principles design through architecture, cognitive bias through psychology, and complex information systems through neuroscience, all of which prepared me to design WISDOM and analyze its data appropriately. As a successful high-stakes poker player, I learned to balance risk and reward, contributing winnings to open science and demonstrating my commitment to the vision. Through FOK, I learned entrepreneurialism and open source management, while building a network of open science advocates for WISDOM.
I founded Open Heart + Mind (OHM) and prototyped WISDOM by hosting inclusive, gift-based gatherings, transforming a theoretical model and personal project into a functioning system and registered charity. My evolution from independent researcher to effective leader showcases my ability to scale projects, while integrating the diverse skills of system design, community building, and rigorous analysis.

### What assumptions about the future of science and technology are baked into your proposal? What are the ways in which those assumptions are most likely to be wrong?
WISDOM is designed from first principles, avoiding reliance on critical assumptions about the future of science and technology. While it assumes certain trends, it doesn’t depend on them and can enhance them regardless of direction.
1. Science will become more distributed and complex, with increased participation from global citizen scientists. WISDOM supports this by enabling anyone to contribute through simple pairwise comparisons, earning rewards for valuable review data.
2. Most actors are committed to knowledge creation. WISDOM reinforces this by rewarding valuable contributions and allowing the community to detect bad actors via open metrics, who may be expelled or given a ‘bill’ representing their detracted value.
3. Diverse communities will accept the idea of quantifying values like gratitude – perhaps my most flawed assumption, given limited levels of resistance at OHM (less so at AIMOS). For this reason, we will validate the model in open science communities before expanding elsewhere.
Why isn’t this problem likely to be adequately addressed (at this stage) by academia, government, or industry?
The collective action problem in open science requires a new transformative model focused on the explicit recognition, reward and incentivisation of public goods, including reviews themselves. 

This problem is unlikely to be resolved within academia, as both academics and their institutions are tightly bound within the same multi-level collective action problem that has withheld progress since the internet was developed. Researchers also tend to be very busy, limiting the actions they can take outside of paid research hours. This problem is also likely too complex and intricate to be solved by governments, which lack the agility required to experiment with novel evaluation systems. It is also unlikely to solved by industry, which benefits fom existing revenue streams and favors proprietary solutions over open infrastructure. 

### Who do you envision using your residency’s outputs, and how?
Primary users include:
- Participants of open science conferences, community gatherings, or journal clubs, who may collectively value diverse event contributions
- Contributors to open science projects (e.g., preprint review platforms), who may rate diverse contributions to projects (e.g., administration tasks, code, engagement with the platform)
- Astera Residents and Open Science Fellows, who may collectively value contributions to their projects
- Funders, who may receive gratitude for their financial contributions, elevating their decision-making power
- OHM gathering participants, who may rate diverse contributions to our events
Once validated in these primary communities, we may extend WISDOM’s application to:
- Broader scientific communities to evaluate research outputs
- Open source projects for contribution tracking and reward
- Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) for reputation-based governance
- Commons-oriented communities (e.g., environmental groups)

### How long have you been thinking about this problem? How much progress have you made on it?
I’ve been thinking about this problem since 2016 and actively exploring solutions since founding FOK in 2018. I designed an open-rating model and prototyped one aspect at the 2021 eLife Innovation Sprint. In 2021 I founded Open Heart + Mind (OHM) to prototype WISDOM in the safer context of gifting festivals, then validating the model for academia by application to the AIMOS 2023 open science conference. We presented this data at AIMOS conference this week and have been invited by the president to explore integrations, such as rating conference proposals and pre-selecting preprints for review at MetaROR, the new meta-research review platform. I’ve also discussed WISDOM with other open science communities, including the Center for Open Science and PREreview, who similarly expressed interest in exploring integrations. 

Alongside these efforts, our team of volunteer developers have built a proof-of-concept web app (wisdohm.openheartmind.org) and drafted design artifacts for an MVP app.

### Do you have a history of involvement in open science or open-source projects?
Yes, I've been deeply involved in open science since 2018, contributing to open infrastructure and research papers on open science. Through FOK, I campaigned for open science projects over several years, then handed the project and open source infrastructure to a new board in 2023. Through OHM, we're making all WISDOM documentation, code, and data openly available. I’ve presented on FOK and WISDOM at over 30 international events, including several invited talks and panel discussions. 

In addition to this work, I’ve also contributed to and had roles in a wide range open science projects and communities, including:

- IGDORE member (2019-24)
- Open Science MOOC presenter (2019)
- Center for Open Science Ambassador (2019-2021)
- SIPS member / conference attendee (2019-24)
- AIMOS member / conference attendee (2019-24) 
- Open Life Science Leaders program (2020)
- eLife Innovation Sprint (2020)
- Access 2 Perspectives member (2024)

### How have you dealt with mistakes or failures in the past? Have you ever failed at something significant in a public way?
I've always focussed on turning mistakes and failures into opportunities for growth and learning. After a false start in architecture, I traveled the world and eventually discovered an interest in consciousness at a meditation retreat. I returned home to study psychology and neuroscience, but fell into depression following my disillusionment with academia. Rather than quitting, I returned to my roots, resuming a daily meditation practice and traveling to the Netherlands on a competitive scholarship. There, I founded Free Our Knowledge (FOK) and chose to prioritize it over an offer for my former ‘dream job’ –  a postdoctoral meditation researcher. After failing to get FOK funded through traditional means, I used poker winnings to self-fund it. While FOK didn't succeed as I had envisioned – my most significant public 'failure' – I’m proud of myself for trying and grateful for the lessons I learned, which strengthened my capacity to develop more comprehensive solutions through WISDOM.

### What is the most impressive (by your own judgment) thing you’ve ever done that would not be obvious from your LinkedIn?
Building Open Heart + Mind (OHM) from scratch as an introvert, while recovering from PhD burnout. What started as a safe space to prototype WISDOM grew into a vibrant community and charity, to which I was elected president. Following a lifetime of independent pursuits, including self-funding FOK through poker, I found myself thrust into the public spotlight with a community looking to me for leadership. I had never been in a leadership position before and only recently completed the open science leaders program, which focussed on online community and not real-world leadership. I’ve made mistakes in my newfound role, many of which have been public and painful for myself and others, but I’ve done my best to learn each time. Through this process, I’ve grown from being a fiercely independent overgiver into a more rounded leader who can set boundaries and focus on priorities and have witnessed the joy, connection and growth that this work has brought to hundreds of people in our community. 
What gets you out of bed in the morning?
- Gratitude for the many blessings of life, both big and small: the ability to breathe, and the opportunity to pursue my dreams with the support of loved ones who believe in me. 

- The dream of a gifting economy, where everyone has their basic needs met and can pursue their purpose without compromising their integrity or health; receiving fair recognition in the form of digitized values, which can be paid forward to others, in turn.

- Gratitude to finally have found my role to play in the puzzle of averting climate change, after searching for over 20 years; discovering a tractable path with which we can reclaim control of our information systems, so that we can work together and regenerate the environment.

- And finally, witnessing the effects of my actions as I walk this path; to see how OHM and the WISDOM project have brought gratitude, joy and connection to our diverse community in Australia and, increasingly, around the world. 


### What is the most exciting scientific or technical problem to you other than the one you described above?
The most exciting scientific problem to me remains the one I embarked on 15 years ago: understanding consciousness. I began my PhD aiming to use neurophenomenology to combine first-person phenomenological methods (e.g., trained introspection and meditation) with third-person neuroscientific measurements (Varela, 1996). However, I soon realized that academia is biased against these questions and shifted my focus to academic reform.
Nevertheless, I remain deeply fascinated by this idea and hope that WISDOM may one day facilitate such research through the autonomous distribution of research grants. Beyond creating new funding pathways, WISDOM might also advance consciousness research by generating high-signal datasets to train networks of aligned AI agents. These agents could represent both individual and collective values, enabling a richer understanding of consciousness at multiple levels.






## DeSci Conference Bangkok Grant application (Oct 2024)
WISDOM: A Decentralized Framework for Community-Driven Value Recognition and Reward

#### Project Abstract (Max 300 words)
The Weighted Information Schema for Distributed Open Merit (WISDOM) is a radically inclusive, decentralized framework for autonomous recognition and reward of diverse contributions. WISDOM addresses fair value attribution in collaborative efforts, particularly in commons-oriented fields like open source, academia, and community projects.

At its core, WISDOM features a fast, simple review protocol based on pairwise comparisons, where reviewers choose between pairs of contributions on community-selected dimensions (e.g., gratitude). The key innovation lies in recognizing reviews as valuable contributions, rewarding them with a standard 'unit of value’, and using them to scale the relative value of all other contributions. This is achieved through meta-reviews, where reviews are embedded into the same review process and compared to regular contributions. Open source algorithms then convert these data into multidimensional scores for all contributions, with each unit representing the value of a single pairwise comparison. Critically, reviews are directly rewarded and never more complex than a simple pairwise comparison, incentivising feedback and maximizing the ‘wisdom of the crowd’ through diverse representation.

WISDOM encompasses six key processes: 
1. Record: Transparently documenting diverse contributions 
2. Review: Employing pairwise comparisons for inclusive evaluations and meta-evaluations 
3. Recognize: Generating multidimensional representations of contribution quality 
4. Reward: Distributing funds or tokens based on community-validated value 
5. Respect: Building reputation metrics for expertise and reviewer reliability 
6. Research: Conducting meta-research to iterate on the system

WISDOM has been prototyped at community arts gatherings and open science conferences, recognizing often-overlooked contributions and validating its inclusivity and adaptability to diverse populations. By standardizing contribution value across diverse fields and fostering a virtuous cycle of value creation, WISDOM aims to empower contributors, build trust, and connect communities through a dynamically-evolving, interconnected web of digitally-encoded values. 

#### What is the potential impact of your project on your field and society? (Max 200 words)
WISDOM has the potential to transform how value is recognized and rewarded across various fields and society at large. Its impact could be far-reaching:
Scientific Progress: By incentivizing open peer review and recognizing diverse contributions, WISDOM could accelerate scientific advancement and improve research quality.
Open Source Development: The framework could revolutionize how open source projects attribute value, potentially leading to more sustainable funding models for critical digital infrastructure.
Community Empowerment: By providing a transparent, inclusive system for recognizing contributions, WISDOM could strengthen community bonds and increase participation in collective efforts.
Meritocratic Governance: Reputation metrics generated by WISDOM could inform more equitable, expertise-based decision-making processes in autonomous organizations.
Economic Innovation: By creating a standardized "language" of contribution value, WISDOM could facilitate the development of new economic models based on gifting and actual value creation, rather than arbitrary metrics.
Cross-domain Collaboration: The framework's adaptability could foster unprecedented cooperation between diverse fields, connecting communities with aligned goals.
AI Training: By generating high-quality, values-aligned data, WISDOM could contribute to the development of more trustworthy and beneficial AI systems.
Social Equity: By recognizing and rewarding all forms of contribution, WISDOM could help address systemic biases in current value attribution systems, promoting a more inclusive society.

#### How could your project leverage blockchain, Web3, or decentralized infrastructures? (Max 200 words)
WISDOM is inherently aligned with decentralized principles and could leverage blockchain and Web3 technologies in several ways:
Immutable Record-Keeping: Blockchain can provide a transparent, tamper-proof ledger for recording contributions, reviews, and meta-reviews, ensuring data integrity.
Smart Contracts: Automated reward distribution based on WISDOM's algorithms could be implemented through smart contracts, ensuring fairness and reducing administrative overhead.
Tokenization: WISDOM's gratitude tokens (e.g., OHMnoms) could be implemented as blockchain-based tokens, facilitating seamless exchange within and between communities.
Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs): WISDOM's reputation metrics could inform governance structures in DAOs, enabling merit-based voting systems.
Interoperability: Web3 standards could allow different WISDOM implementations to communicate, enabling cross-community collaboration and value exchange.
Decentralized Storage: Technologies like IPFS could be used to store WISDOM data in a distributed manner, enhancing resilience and reducing centralization risks.
Self-Sovereign Identity: Web3 identity solutions could be integrated to manage user profiles and reputation across different WISDOM implementations.
Zero-Knowledge Proofs: These could be employed to verify contribution values or expertise levels without revealing sensitive information.
By leveraging these technologies, WISDOM can enhance its core principles of transparency, inclusivity, and decentralization, creating a robust, scalable system for recognizing and rewarding value across diverse communities.

## ResBaz Victoria 2024 proposals (Oct 2024)
### Bio
Dr Cooper Smout is a designer, researcher and lifelong student of human behaviour. Inspired by a Vipassana meditation retreat, he left a promising career in architecture to study Psychology and Neuroscience at the University of Queensland, winning prizes for both his Honours and PhD theses in the neural mechanisms of visual awareness.

Cooper’s passion for good design found a counterpart in the scholarly publishing industry, igniting a new interest in Open Science and the problem of cultural change in academia. He founded the world’s first collective action platform for researchers (Free Our Knowledge) and spent several years campaigning for open and reproducible research practices, later drawing on these experiences to design a decentralised peer-review model with disruptive potential. Realising he could make faster progress outside of academia, he founded a citizen-science project (Open Heart + Mind) and prototyped by peer-reviewing contributions to community gatherings, before validating the model for use in academia by peer-reviewing contributions to Open Science conferences. 

Alongside his interests in Open Science and decentralised technologies, Cooper enjoys playing games, snowboarding, rockclimbing, meditating, dancing, and spending time in nature.

### Talk title
WISDOM: An open value accounting framework for diverse communities

### Description
In this talk, I'll introduce WISDOM, an open value accounting framework that empowers communities to recognise diverse contributions and directly reward contributors for their efforts.

I’ll begin with an overview of the framework, showing how it began life as an open peer-review model and evolved through active experimentation to become a generalisable framework for diverse communities. I’ll highlight the key innovation: the use of pairwise comparisons as both an inclusive review protocol and a ‘standard unit of contribution’, which serve to peg the value(s) of all other contributions in a decentralised and autonomous manner.

I’ll demonstrate the framework’s adaptability by sharing data from diverse communities in the arts, science and technology sectors, before focussing on an academic use case where we used WISDOM to quantify the value of contributions to the two most recent AIMOS metaresearch and open science conferences. I’ll show how WISDOM (a) revealed community values and several contributions that might otherwise have gone unnoticed, (b) incentivised open peer-review, and (c) estimated contribution value on multiple dimensions of interest. I’ll highlight how WISDOM facilitates metaresearch by sharing results of several analyses we've conducted, then invite questions and suggestions from the audience.

I’ll close with a vision for how WISDOM can help connect diverse communities in the research space and beyond, along with an invitation to use WISDOM to review, recognise and reward contributions to ResBaz itself. 

### Workshop title
Reviewing, recognising and rewarding diverse contributions to ResBaz

### Description
The Weighted Information Schema for Distributed Open Merit (WISDOM) is an open science and meta-research framework for estimating the relative value of contributions to diverse communities. It features an inclusive review protocol and a decentralised, autonomous process to estimate contribution value, which can be used to recognise, reward and respect contributors for the value they create. 

In this workshop, we’ll learn how to use WISDOM to review and recognise diverse contributions to any community, using ResBaz as a working example. We’ll begin with an introduction to the prototype we used to review contributions to the AIMOS 2023 and 2024 open science conferences, showing how data moved through the model pipeline (Record, Review, Recognise, Reward, and Respect) and results of several other analyses.

Next, we’ll start work on the ResBaz Victoria 2024 prototype. Participants will be invited to nominate contributions and dimensions for rating via an online survey. We’ll edit the list of contributions and select a representative sample for review. We’ll discuss pros and cons of different rating dimensions, then choose a set of dimensions on which to rate ResBaz contributions. 

We’ll also aim to complete some reviews during the workshop itself, so please bring a laptop or tablet if you have one available. We’ll close the session with a round of reflections on the process, an overview of next steps, and an invitation to contribute further to the project. 





## Zu-Grama application (Oct 2024)
### ZuGrama is all about cross-pollination of ideas, which fields of technology should intersect more and why? 
Open science and decentralised science (DeSci). I've been part of the Open Science movement for over 6 years now, and feel there are many lessons to be learned but very little contact between these fields. The DeSci movement could learn from the successes and failures in the Open Science space, where systemic change and disruption has been attempted for over 30 years with minimal success. The core problem remains one of culture, not technology, and there is plenty of research and relevant experience to be learned from. Conversely, the Open Science space could benefit from the technical proficiency and innovation in DeSci, but I rarely see DeSci projects represented at Open Science or Meta-research conferences. There is clearly an alignment there and I think a missed opportunity to learn from one another and become stronger by working together.   

### ZuGrama is co-built by all the participants. You’ll have the opportunity to create any session in ZuGrama’s permissionless bottom-up programming, what would you like to contribute and in what field? 
I would like to host sessions to introduce the WISDOM framework: https://github.com/openheartmind/WISDOM
https://openheartmind.org/research/

WISDOM is an adaptable framework for estimating the collective value of diverse contributions. It features an inclusive open peer-review protocol, direct incentive mechanism and open algorithms that automatically produce relative valuations for every contribution, on multiple dimensions of interest. 

I'd love to explore the framework with the Zu-Grama community, collecting open peer-review data and generating a relative valuation of contributions to Zu-Grama itself. This could then serve as a proof-of-concept for a decentralized 'template' to recreate Zu-Grama in the future, as well as a funding distribution mechanism and platform for governance.

At present, we have a working prototype that we've validated at both community arts gatherings and open science conferences. We're currently developing an MVP, however, and are expecting to have that ready for testing at Zu-Grama.   

### Fast forward 10 years. What would you have achieved that you would consider impactful, either personally or for the world? How would you like ZuGrama to help you achieve this vision?
In 10 years, I aim to have established WISDOM as a foundational framework for recognizing and rewarding diverse contributions across multiple domains - spanning open science, community projects and the Web3 space. The system would be empowering a global network of communities to fairly evaluate contributions, distribute rewards, and make decisions based on validated expertise rather than traditional hierarchies.   Key milestones would include:
* Proven implementation across 100+ communities
* Integration with major open science platforms
* Development of interoperable token systems between aligned communities
* Creation of robust reputation systems for expertise-based governance 
ZuGrama's Role: The village could accelerate this vision by:
* Providing a testing ground for WISDOM among diverse creators and technologists
* Facilitating connections with other projects working on decentralized governance
* Offering space to prototype and iterate on the framework with immediate feedback
* Creating opportunities to integrate WISDOM into the village's own decision-making processes

### What is an area of technology or science that you believe is underexplored but holds immense potential for human flourishing? Describe how you would start investigating this area if you had unlimited resources.  
Contemplative, values-aligned AI. I believe that much like meditation is beneficial for humans, building meditation-like processes into AI could be hugely beneficial for human flourishing and may help solve the alignment issue.   If we had unlimited resources, I would airdrop progressively larger amounts of money into diverse communities using the WISDOM system, creating a virtuous cycle in which contributors are directly rewarded for the value they create and are thus incentivised to maintain engagement.  These rewards could be targeted to incentivise research into contemplative, values-aligned AI. For example, we might conduct research into subjective measures of individual vs collective value, as an analogue for the meditation processes of emptiness and mindfulness. We might also recognise and reward those contributions that produce ‘higher-order’ states, like gratitude and joy.   The datasets generated by such a vast network of diverse WISDOM communities could then become a high-signal training ground for a complex network of values-aligned AI, which may collaborate to solve pressing issues and maximise human flourishing.   

### Applications can be tricky. If we were to ignore all the questions and answers, and you had the chance to tell us something that would make us want you at ZuGrama, what would it be?  
I've been trying to find my place in the problem of climate change for over 20 years now. This took me on a winding path through many disciplines, before having my heart broken by academia and finding salvation in the Open Science movement. Since then, I've been trying to kickstart cultural change in academia. Through prototyping at community arts gatherings, I believe I've now stumbled upon a general-purpose solution that can address all kinds of collective action problems in diverse communities, like Zu-Grama. I've poured my heart and soul into this project because I believe that a gift-based future is not only possible, but is absolutely necessary if we're going to come together and solve the incredibly complex problems we face as a global society. I believe a critical part of that journey will be connecting and empowering the global South, and I hope to forge new connections in India through the ZuGrama residency.   

### Did someone refer you?* 
I heard about Zu-Grama at ZuBerlin and have been following the Telegram groups since then. But can't remember who it was that mentioned it.   

### Is there someone you want to refer to ZuGrama?* 
Dipanshu Singh, dipanshuhappy@gmail.com, @agentDPS   

### How much financial assistance would you need and why? Give us a brief description how much assistance you need in dollars on why you need financial assistance.
I’m seeking a fully-funded ZuGrama Fellowship, as mentioned on the Zu-Grama Telegram. I've been self-funding my Open Science projects for over 6 years now. I was playing poker to support myself, but over the past year and a half have been focussing almost exclusively on the WISDOM project so that we can get these ideas out into the world and start connecting communities. I’ve poured everything I have into this project and would do it all over again, but systemic change is a slow process and radically different ideas take time to take root.    

### Describe a complex problem you’ve worked on recently. How did you approach it, and what frameworks or methods did you use to break it down and find a solution?  
The main problem I've been trying to solve for 6+ years is the collective action problem keeping researchers locked into the broken journal system. I began by researching alternative models, before realising that many alternatives already exist but people aren't using them. This lead to my first project, a collective action platform that organised conditional pledges as an attempt to solve the problem socially. I spent several years campaigning and researching the best models in the Open Science space, but eventually learned that this approach is too slow and we require a significantly better model to motivate change. 

I researched entrepreneurship and disruption, then went back to the drawing board to design a novel model from first principles that had all the necessary features for disrupting academia. I began pitching within academia, but realised I would need a safer environment to prototype rapidly, so left and founded a community where we hosted gift-based festivals and iterated on the model by peer-reviewing festival contributions, as an analogue for academia and other commons-oriented spaces. About a year later, I stumbled upon the current WISDOM model and realised that it solves many of the problems I has been thinking on for several years. 

We validated the model internally at OHM, then returned to academia to share the data and model at an open science conference, before using that conference as the next prototype and validation of the model.  





## Edge City Demo Day application (Oct 2024)
The Weighted Information Schema for Distributed Open Merit (WISDOM) is an open science framework that empowers communities to self-evaluate the quality of diverse contributions. It features a user-friendly, open peer-review protocol with direct rewards for feedback, thus incentivising engagement. The key innovation is the use of meta-reviews to quantify the relative value of reviews themselves, which are then used to generate relative valuations for all recorded contributions, given in standard units equivalent to the value of a single review. 

WISDOM is free and open source, can be adapted to a wide variety of use cases and values, and generates data that may be useful for autonomous reward and governance by communities at Edge City. In this presentation, I'll introduce the model, give a live demo of our spreadsheet prototype and proof-of-concept web app, then close with an invitation to ideate and collaborate.






## [Funding the Commons DoraHacks BUIDL](https://dorahacks.io/buidl/17042/team) description (Oct 2024)
WISDOM: Autonomous value recognition and reward for self-organising communities
In collaborative efforts, how do we ensure that every contribution is properly valued and every voice is heard? The Weighted Information Schema for Distributed Open Merit (WISDOM) is an open science framework for recognising the value of diverse contributions through open peer-review. It features an inclusive review protocol where every review is directly rewarded, incentivising engagement. Reviews are then weighted according to open source algorithms trained on meta-review data, resulting in a crowd-level representation of the unique qualities of every contribution. This rich dataset can then be filtered in a myriad of ways, generating automatic rewards for contributors and reputation metrics for merit-based governance.





## Cooper's homepage
### Landing page
I'm the founder and President of Open Heart + Mind (OHM), a charity community creating diverse gatherings as a safe space to prototype transformative models for society. My passion project is WISDOM, an open review, recognition and reward framework designed to connect and empower diverse communities (see more on my projects page).

My career journey began in architecture, pivoted at a meditation retreat, and passed through and out the other side of a PhD when I realised that the academic game is broken. Since then, I've been playing a different kind of game to fund my dream of a fair open science system, where everyone gets to play (more on my journey here).

### About me
Hi, thanks for dropping by :)

My journey into academia began at a Vipassana meditation retreat in Thailand, where I discovered a previously unimagined depth to my own mind and resolved to explore consciousness from all angles – through philosophy, meditation, psychology and neuroscience. I returned home to complete an undergraduate degree in psychology and an award-winning honours thesis in cognitive neuroscience, before embarking on a PhD in the neural mechanisms of visual awareness. Partway through the PhD, I attempted to publish my first paper and was shocked to discover a highly inefficient scholarly publishing system that wastes time and resources, biases the literature and pressures researchers into compromising their integrity. I also realised that employment prospects are pretty grim in academia, throwing me into a state of disillusionment – if I carried down this path, would I be forced to compromise my scientific integrity to survive in academia? Did I really want to compete with friends and colleagues for too little funding? Was the system even capable of supporting the types of big questions I’m interested in asking? Everywhere I looked, I saw evidence of overworked and burned-out researchers, many of whom had decided to leave academia after years of chasing short-term postdoc contracts around the world.

This disillusionment, coupled with other life stressors at the time, threw me into a deep depression that lasted the latter half of my PhD (incidentally, mental health problems are rife throughout academia). Since graduating, I’ve been rebuilding my mental health and regaining balance, thanks in large part to self-compassion meditation, dancing, and finding hope in the open science movement, which aims to create a fairer system while opening the research pipeline to public scrutiny. Toward the end of my PhD, I joined the Institute for Globally Distributed Open Research and Education and founded a collective action platform that aims to help researchers reclaim control of academia and restore balance in the research ecosystem (Project Free Our Knowledge). After spending far too much time coming oh-so-close to winning funding for this project, I realised I could earn more money playing poker and decided to leave academia to self-fund instead. In 2021, I placed in a few good-sized tournaments and came second on the Australian Poker Tour leaderboard, validating my decision to go ‘rogue’.

I’m now devoting all of my spare energy to Open Heart + Mind (OHM), a community-turned charity where we’ve been testing and iterating on an open review model that I designed to disrupt scholarly publishing, before realising I needed a safer space to prototype. At the same time, I discovered the creative potential of Burning Man gatherings, based on gifting and decommodification principles, and realised this could serve as an analogue for academia and a safe space to prototype the types of radical models I was dreaming up. This work has brought new challenges, not least of all learning to become a leader and manage a community as a born-introvert and recovering perfectionist. I’m deeply grateful for the learning opportunities this project allows and for all the amazing humans supporting me on this journey to realise my dreams.

In between this work and playing poker to fund it, I try to maintain a healthy balance through music, gardening, dancing, meditating, rockclimbing and spending time in nature.

### WISDOM
WISDOM (Weighted Information Schema for Distributed Open Metrics) is an open review framework designed from first principles to revolutionise the way we recognise and reward contributions. It began life as a disruptive scholarly publishing model and evolved through active experimentation at Open Heart + Mind to become a generalizable framework for diverse, self-organizing communities. By creating a fair, transparent system for recognizing and rewarding all forms of contribution, WISDOM empowers contributors and connects diverse communities with aligned goals.

At the heart of WISDOM is an inclusive review protocol that earns reviewers immediate rewards for their reviews, which are converted into group-level estimates of the relative value of contributions. Contributors can then be directly rewarded for the value they provide, and respected for their proven expertise and reliability. The entire process is open, decentralized and autonomous, ensuring everyone can participate, while guarding against bias and cheating through a self-reflective meta-review process.

## AIMOS 2024 proposals
### Lightning Talk
#### WISDOM: An open science framework for community-driven value accounting
In this lightning talk, I’ll introduce WISDOM (Weighted Information Schema for Distributed Open Merit) and share data from our pilot at the AIMOS 2023 conference. I’ll begin with an overview of the model, showing how it can adapt to diverse use cases and facilitate the collective valuation of contributions according to community-selected values. I’ll highlight the key innovation: the use of pairwise comparisons as both an inclusive review protocol and a ‘standard unit of contribution’, which serve to peg the value(s) of all other contributions in a decentralised and autonomous manner. I’ll share data from our recent prototype, where we used WISDOM to recognise and reward contributions to the AIMOS 2023 conference. I’ll show how we empowered the AIMOS community to: (1) Record diverse contributions, including many that might otherwise go unnoticed; (2) Review contributions according to community-selected dimensions; (3) Recognise contributions for their diverse qualities; (4) Reward contributors for the value they provided; and, (5) Respect reviewers and contributors for their demonstrated expertise. I’ll present our major analyses and system upgrades, showing how this circular process of meta-research and iteration could produce a highly efficient, values-aligned research ecosystem. I’ll close with an invitation to nominate AIMOS 2024 contributions online and attend our follow-up hackathon, thus contributing to the latest iteration of the WISDOM experiment.

## Astera Open Science Fellowship application cover letter (July 2024)
25th July 2024

To the team at Astera, 

It is with great pleasure that I submit my application to become an Astera Open Science Fellow.
My background
I founded a collective action platform for open science practices during my PhD and pursued it over a postgraduate research career, studying entrepreneurship and open source management instead. In parallel, I designed an open numerical review model that I pitched at conferences and developed proof of concept at an eLife Innovation Sprint, before realizing I needed a safer space to prototype. I founded a community-turned-charity and organized a series of gift-based festivals, coordinating open peer-review of festival contributions as an analog for academia. I developed several working prototypes and fed learnings from these experiments into a generalizable framework (WISDOM), which we have now validated for use in academia through the open peer-review and rating of contributions to an open science conference. I’ve been self-funding most of this work to date, but am now seeking mentorship and financial support to scale.
The problem(s)
Preprint review platforms suffer from two major limitations. First, researchers lack incentives to review on these platforms, prioritizing exploitative journals that offer prestige and networking opportunities. Second, preprint review platforms operate as isolated silos without any common standards, limiting interoperability and quality control. Meta-reviews (reviews of reviews) have been proposed as a solution to these problems, but current models are incomplete because they do not incentivise or standardize meta-reviews themselves (“Who reviews the meta-reviews?”). 
Proposed solution (I am open to refining these ideas in collaboration with Astera)
I propose to develop a meta-review platform based on the WISDOM framework that would incentivize and standardize preprint reviews through crowd-sourced quality metrics. In WISDOM, users are immediately rewarded for ‘A vs B’ comparisons between pairs of contributions (in this instance, preprint reviews on existing platforms). Pairwise comparisons can be self-referential, wherein one of the two items being compared is itself some number of pairwise comparisons. This closes the valuation loop, enabling decentralized autonomous valuation and generating a multidimensional representation of preprint review qualities, measured in standard units corresponding to the value of a single pairwise comparison. 
Competitive landscape
I consider preprint review platforms as potential partners rather than competitors (see letter of support), including those that offer meta-review. Reviewer Credits is another platform that offers peer-review recognition and reward, but only for journal reviews, and their quality index is automatic rather than human-generated.  In contrast to existing models, WISDOM offers:
Inclusivity. Fast, simple, user-friendly review process via pairwise comparisons.
Reliability. Controlled experimental design, mitigating bias and guarding against cheating.
Incentives. Direct recognition and reward for reviews/meta-reviews, fostering engagement.
Standardization. A standard unit of value, improving interoperability and comparison.
Decentralization. Crowd-based process, allowing anyone to review/meta-review.
Autonomization. Metrics for autonomous payments (e.g., via bounties, see below).
Flexibility. Customizable parameters, suiting the needs of diverse communities & use cases. 
Generalizability. WISDOM is a domain-general model that can expand to include non-traditional review formats (e.g., social media content, conference proposals – see letters of support) and other contribution types (e.g., project administration), fostering new pathways for collective valuation and collaboration both within and between partner projects.
Skills, team members and collaborations 
I have expertise in design, data science, open source management, and community building, but need support in product management and software development, which I plan to address through mentorship and hiring, respectively. I propose to recognize, reward, and incentivize project contributions using ‘bounties’ distributed via WISDOM metrics. Early bounty rounds can reward meta-reviews and preprint reviews, expanding to include more diverse contributions as our system matures, such as platform development itself (i.e., ‘dog-fooding’). I’m also open to exploring diverse use cases for Astera administration and projects (e.g., Sensemaking Networks).
Openness  
Code, data, and resources (e.g., project boards, contribution records, reviews) will be shared under CC & open source licenses. Community feedback will be collected via an open forum.
Quarterly Milestones 
Q1: User research, develop MVP, begin community outreach, announce bounties
Q2: Beta testing, gather feedback, refine platform, distribute 1st bounty round
Q3: Launch platform, expand outreach, monitor engagement, distribute 2nd bounty round
Q4: Evaluate impact, publish findings, plan growth, distribute 3rd bounty round
Budget 
Personnel Costs: $300,000 ($150k Project Lead, $150k Software Dev Lead)
Bounties: $100,000 ($10k Round 1, $30k Round 2, $60k Round 3)
Compute Costs: $25,000 (Cloud services, data storage, computational resources)
Equipment: $15,000 (Development hardware)
Travel: $30,000 (On-site visits, conferences, community outreach)
Miscellaneous: $30,000 (Marketing, legal fees, contingency)
Working Arrangement  
I would prefer a hybrid arrangement, splitting my time between Berkeley and Brisbane. Thank you for considering my application and I look forward to hearing from you in due course. 

Kind Regards, 

Cooper Smout, Ph.D





## GITHUB README v1 (early 2024)
Hi and welcome to the WISDOM system :)

We're developing a generalizable open scientific framework for recognising and rewarding contributions to the commons, so that we can empower contributors and connect diverse communities with aligned goals. 

### The Problem
Fair recognition and reward are central challenges in collaborative efforts, especially in commons-oriented fields like art, open source and academia. An ideal system should capture, recognise and reward the unique qualities of every contribution, fostering trust and incentivising engagement. 
Modern systems tend to be overly centralised, subjective, biased and/or unreliable, however, incentivising behaviours that reinforce the status quo rather than change it. More broadly, the use of incompatible systems limits the capacity for effective cooperation between organizations with aligned goals. 

### Our Solution
WISDOM is a flexible framework designed to crack the code of cultural change. By creating a standardised measure of gratitude for contributions, WISDOM aims to empower contributors and connect aligned communities in the pursuit of their common goals. 
At the heart of WISDOM is an inclusive review protocol that incentivises feedback about diverse contributions. This input is then converted into a multidimensional representation of the unique qualities of every recorded contribution. Contributors can then be rewarded with tokens representing the collective gratitude for their contibutions, which can be paid forward in thanks to other people in turn. Contributor expertise and reliability can also be expressed numerically, creating a platform for people who consistently deliver value to their community.
 
### Minimal Viable Model (MVM)
_0. Select Dimensions._ Communities can embed their values directly into the code by choosing the dimensions that contributions are rated on. WISDOM builds on previous [open evaluation models](https://doi.org/10.3389/fncom.2012.00079) that suggest a common 'primary dimension' can facilitate cross-comparison between communities. We propose "Gratitude" as the primary dimension because of its universal applicability and psychological benefits for communities of practice, but communities are free to choose any number of dimensions that reflect their values and particular use cases. 
_1. Record._ Contributions are recorded in a transparent register of the community's choice. The scale and scope of recorded contributions depends on the community, and members are incentivised to keep the register current, complete and accurate. 
_2. Review._ WISDOM uses pairwise comparisons to generate ratings at the crowd-level. Pairwise comparisons are a quick, simple and user-friendly review protocol, making them inclusive to diverse people irrespective of expertise or technical prowess. Anyone in the community can complete a pairwise comparison by voting between two contributions on each dimension of interest (e.g., "Which of these two contributions are you most grateful for?"). Reliable reviewers can also earn the status of '_meta-reviewer_', which entitles them to vote on the relative value of reviews themselves (termed a '_meta-review_'). 
_3. Recognise._ Pairwise comparisons are relatively uniform, meaning that we can treat them as a 'standard unit' of contribution and use them to scale all other contributions. We do this by including a range of review contributions (e.g., 32, 64, and 128 pairwise comparisons) in the meta-review stage and fitting a function to the resulting votes, then interpolating values for all non-review contributions (see _3. Recognise_ tab in our [pilot dataset](http://tiny.cc/tinyOHMresults)). The result is a numerical value representing the collective gratitude for every single contribution (see _Gratitude per contribution_ chart in our [pilot dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HS7HFa9y6PfF61_wTuCAbj9RTHe94VLXulS0pDYgtns/edit?usp=sharing)). Communities who include more than one review dimension can generate a multi-dimensional information matrix about each and every contribution (see _Contribution Qualities_ chart in our [pilot dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HS7HFa9y6PfF61_wTuCAbj9RTHe94VLXulS0pDYgtns/edit?usp=sharing)), which can be filtered to suit the needs of the user and their community.
_4. Reward._ Contributors can then be rewarded with tokens representing the collective gratitude for their contributions (see _OHMnoms per Contributor_ chart in our [pilot dataset](http://tiny.cc/tinyOHMresults)). Reviews are rewarded at the rate of 1 token per pairwise comparison (including all dimensions), and regular contributions are rewarded commensurate to the number of units on the Gratitude dimension (more complicated transfer functions could be explored in the future). Communities may agree to subtract common costs (e.g., the average cost of an event), leaving a balance that reflects each contributor’s total energetic exchange with the community (see _OHMnom Balances_ chart in our [pilot dataset](http://tiny.cc/tinyOHMresults)). Excess tokens can be paid forward to other people who the contributor wishes to thank in turn, forming the basis of an evidence-based gifting economy.
_5. Respect._ By measuring contributions over time, we can generate metrics reflecting reviewer reliability and expertise within the community. Reviewer reliability can be measured using a range of measures (e.g., test-retest reliability, internal consistency), and trustworthy reviewers can be elevated to the status of _meta-reviewer_ (see _Reviewer Reliability_ chart in our [pilot dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HS7HFa9y6PfF61_wTuCAbj9RTHe94VLXulS0pDYgtns/edit?usp=sharing)). Experts in particular fields and topics can be identified by tracking the value they add to that field over time (e.g., see _Expertise: Science_ chart in our [pilot dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HS7HFa9y6PfF61_wTuCAbj9RTHe94VLXulS0pDYgtns/edit?usp=sharing)). Collectively, these metrics could form the basis of a merit-based participatory democracy algorithm, in which votes are weighted according to each person's validated expertise in the topic of interest. 

### Replicate and Repeat
All of the above processes should be conducted transparently and shared with the community, so that everyone can learn and grow together. The final stage is therefore to replicate the previous materials, embed any learnings, and repeat the process again. 

### Principles and Features
- _Transparent_. Contributions and reviews are shared publicly, so you know what's going on behind the scenes.
- _Inclusive_. Everyone is rewarded for their unique contributions, including reviews, meaning that everyone can contribute in the way that works for them.
- _Replicable_. Open source and forkable, so you can stand on the shoulders of giants.
- _Accessible_. Our review protocol is user-friendly and cognitively simple, so that anyone can contribute meaningful data no matter their circumstances.
- _Collaborative_. Our crowd-based reward mechanism incentivises collaboration over competition.
- _Diverse_. Our framework is flexible, scaleable and can be customised to the needs of different communities.
- _Honest_. Transparent reviews and reliability metrics encourage honesty and guard against cheats. 

### A Generalizable Framework
WISDOM is designed to be maximally inclusive to all communities. The MVM above is the simplest model possible for capturing quantitative meta-information -- information about the relative value of information. There are of course more nuanced ways to conduct reviews, but all of these can be considered derivatives of the MVM and could be valued accordingly (e.g., by valuing a lengthy written review in an equivalent number of pairwise comparisons). Communities are free to develop their own extensions to the core model, ideally sharing these developments publicly so that other communities can also adopt those extensions that make sense for them (and thanking each other accordingly). 
Each community can then decide which other communities to cooperate and trade tokens with, by assessing their transparent processes and data and deciding (if necessary) a relative weighting for the respective tokens. Providing that all communities adopt the MVM we present here, it would create a fundamental communication layer both within and between communities that directly encodes gratitude and facilitates cooperation toward common goals.
By integrating the three key functions of _communication_, _economics_ and _governance_, WISDOM aims to become a complete 'community operating system' for practically _any_ community.
 
#### Communication
WISDOM generates multidimensional, quantitative metadata (data about the relative qualities of data) that can be filtered in an infinite variety of ways and communicated globally. By embedding community values directly into the codebase, we can generate data that reflects those qualities and create a high-signal training ground for trustworthy AI. In contrast, the vast majority of current AI systems are trained on web-scraped data from the internet, which is niaively biased at best, and actively tuned toward suboptimal values at worst (e.g., profit, division, attention). 

#### Economics
In contrast to modern society, WISDOM places economics downstream from information gathering and communication. Communities are free to develop their own process and name for their token/s. At OHM, we call our gratitude tokens OHMnoms, in reference to the delicious little treats that our members contribute to the cOHMunity (or alternatively, as shorthand for the _nom_inations their contributions receive). OHMnoms are calculated by applying a function to the meta-information matrix. The current version of the algorithm is very simple -- a 1-to-1 mapping of the Gratitude dimension -- meaning that OHMnoms are a direct measure of the collective gratitude for contributions. In the future, this algorithm may be developed to include more variables, but for now we're just keeping it simple.
Other communities are free to develop their own calculation method and name for their own token. Each community could then decide what other communities to cooperate and trade with, e.g., by assessing their processes and data and determining a relative weighting for the respective tokens (if necessary). Providing that all communities adopt the MVM we present here, it would create a fundamental communication layer both within and between communities that directly encodes gratitude and facilitates cooperation toward common goals. 

#### Governance
WISDOM can also generate a governance framework where community members earn the right to have more say in how the community is governed. By tracking the relative value of contributions over time, we can build a representation of each person's expertise (or experience points) across different projects (e.g., hOHM Base), fields (e.g., music) or combinations thereof (e.g., music at hOHM Base). Core contributors might then have more influence over the direction of the project or community, for example by weighting votes in a collective voting process. This results in a process where everyone can have their say and be heard, but we listen more to those people who have been validated as experts within the community. 
Experience points could be visualised as concentric rings, with the inner-most ring representing a 'circle' of the most experienced contributors (e.g., 2 people) and outer rings including less experienced contributors. We're calling this model the WISDOM Tree, by analogy to the growth rings that show the age of a tree. Each community who adopts this model could be visualised as a tree in a forest, with the trunk representing their core community and branches representing each project or sub-community. This analogy only goes so far, because in contrast to a physical tree, our model is infinitely filterable and can therefore be dynamically updated at the click of a button. But hey, that's why we love data at OHM. 

### Usage Examples
1. Gatherings. See [data and results](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HS7HFa9y6PfF61_wTuCAbj9RTHe94VLXulS0pDYgtns/edit?usp=sharing) from a [Open Heart + Mind (OHM)](https://github.com/openheartmind) gathering called Tiny OHM (see also [/reports](https://github.com/openheartmind/WISDOM/tree/main/reports)). We're also prototyping with [Vibe Camp](https://github.com/vibecamp) to review [contributions to Vibeclipse](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t1mzPUlnKUeTf_lUKJySg1yiL5AxLkMORp6L5ZHOTww/edit?usp=sharing).

4. Scholarly communication. Our model was originally designed to solve cultural inertia in the transition to open science platforms. If you work in the scholarly communication / evaluation space, we'd love to hear from you! 
5. Literally any contribution to _any_ community. We think of WISDOM as a _minimal universal model_, meaning that it is both flexible and adaptable to different community needs. We're collecting a list of organisations interested in exploring the framework, please add your name [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XF9CagLX1WUXaPy-HDYlY4kZv8HZngEGu7lM6EQnvy4/edit?usp=sharing) if interested so we can get in touch.

### About OHM
[Open Heart + Mind (OHM)](https://github.com/openheartmind) is a diverse community who have been prototyping the WISDOM framework since 2022 at our inclusive gift-based gatherings. We endeavour to make all of our documents, contributions, reviews and other materials publicly available under [open source licenses](https://doc.clickup.com/36615879/d/h/12xdp7-382/ed51fc76f354e55), but for the first two years chose to prototype in a third-party app called Clickup for reasons of usability and accessibility for our cOHMunity (contact if you'd like access). Github Projects has come a long way since then, however, and so we're now beginning the migration back to Github so we can be as open as we'd always intended to be. We're also developing an app (WisdOHM) that is our particular instantiation of the WISDOM framework and we're in the process of making open source. 

### About the Founder
Cooper Smout is a designer, data scientist and lifelong student of human behavior. During his PhD he became fascinated with the problem of incentivising open science practices and founded the [worlds first collective action platform for researchers](https://freeourknowledge.org/), aiming to overcome cultural inertia through conditional pledges. Drawing on insights from this work, he then designed a novel model for scholarly communication that aimed to incentivise participation by generating prestige through AI-powered open evaluation. Realising that this model was likely too radical for risk-averse academics, and inspired by the creativity of Burning man-style events, he left academia to prototype in the safer, more dynamic and inclusive environment of [gift-based gatherings](https://doc.clickup.com/36615879/d/h/12xdp7-722/0579897aba652af), where he has been dancing and collaborating with amazing humans since. 

### About the Name
WISDOM stands for Weighted Information Schema for Distributed Open science and Meta-research... or something like that (it's more the sentiment that counts). 





## Random bits
WISDOM (Weighted Information Schema for Distributed Open Merit) is a radically inclusive, empirical framework for autonomously measuring the relative value of community contributions, while incentivising engagement. 

It features a user-friendly, open peer-review protocol based on pairwise comparisons, where individuals can express their values by voting between pairs of contributions on multiple dimensions of interest. Individuals are immediately rewarded for the comparisons they complete, incentivising community members to engage with the system and provide valuable feedback, irrespective of their level of technological or project expertise.

The key innovation is in recognising pairwise comparisons as valuable contributions in their own right, and using them to scale the relative value of all other contributions. This is achieved through a novel meta-review process, where batches of reviews themselves are embedded in the comparison process and compared to regular contributions.  

Open source algorithms then convert these inputs into multidimensional  relative valuations of every contribution, on multiple dimensions reflecting community values. 

Crucially, throughout this entire process, no one person needs to do anything more complicated than a pairwise comparison, ensuring that the entire process remains accessible to the entire community. 

### Radically inclusive
WISDOM is designed from first principles to be maximally inclusive at both the individual and collective levels. At the individual level, community members peer-review each other's contributions via a simple, user-friendly review protocol based on pairwise comparisons. Critically, each of these comparisons is recognised as a valuable contribution in its own right and directly rewarded, providing a powerful incentive to engage with the system. At the collective level, communities can determine the dimensions on which their contributions are rated, aligning incentives and ensuring individual contributions are properly valued with respect to the collective vision and mission. Critically, these valuations are generated in standardised, interoperable units, meaning that aligned organizations who adopt this same framework can recognise each other’s contributions with respect to shared goals, and share resources in a decentralised and autonomous fashion.

_The Problem_
Recognition and reward are central challenges in collaborative efforts, especially in commons-oriented fields like open source and academia. An ideal system should capture, recognise and reward the unique qualities of every contribution, fostering trust and incentivising quality contributions.

Recognition and reward systems often fall short, however, failing to encompass the full range of contributions (e.g., code in academia), recognise their unique qualities (e.g. replicability), or reward contributors fairly (e.g. open source).

Furthermore, the diversity of systems creates an even more extensive optimisation problem: aligned communities may forgo cooperation due to incompatible systems. Examples abound in the open science space, where aligned projects (e.g. preprint-review platforms) compete for scarce resources (e.g. funding, people), instead of cooperating.

_Our proposal_
We propose to develop a universally applicable, standardised framework for recognising and rewarding contributions, thereby fostering cooperation. Our framework builds on open evaluation models for academia (e.g. Kriegeskorte, 2012), where crowd-ratings can vary on multiple dimensions, including but not limited to a 'primary' dimension. In what follows, I will outline our core model in which the primary dimension is "Gratitude", selected both for its broad applicability to diverse contributions and the neuropsychological benefits of a regular gratitude practice.

Our model uses pairwise comparisons (e.g., "Which of these two contributions are you most grateful for?") to generate ratings at the crowd-level. Pairwise comparisons are a quick, simple and user-friendly review protocol, ensuring that diverse people can contribute data, regardless of expertise or technical prowess.

Pairwise comparisons are also relatively uniform across use cases, meaning that we can use them as a 'standard unit' of contribution. Reviewers are rewarded with one token for every pairwise comparison they complete, representing a single 'unit of gratitude' for their contribution. 

Other contributions are then scaled relative to this standard unit. This is achieved by including pairwise comparisons in the overall contribution set and submitting them for 'meta-review. A qualified reviewer might be given a pair of contributions to review, one of which is itself a review contribution (e.g. 32 pairwise comparisons). By including a range of pairwise comparisons (e.g. 32, 64, 128), we can fit a function to the resulting votes and extrapolate values for all other contributions, giving us a relative level of collective gratitude for every single contribution, given in terms of pairwise comparisons (see 'algorithm' tab in our prototype dataset: [http://tiny.cc/tinyOHMresults](http://tiny.cc/tinyOHMresults))

Contributors can then be automatically rewarded for all of their contributions. Communities might also agree to subtract common costs (e.g. the average cost of an event in tokens), leaving a balance that reflects each contributor’s total energetic exchange with the community (see 'Summary' tab, 'Reward' column, in our prototype dataset). 

By measuring contributions over time, we can also identify key contributors (e.g. reliable reviewers, experts), who might then be given more rewards for their reviews or higher weights in governance votes (see 'Respect').

Finally, contributors can give their tokens to other people who they wish to thank in turn, or  exchanging them for community resources (e.g. money; see "Receive"). Communities with surplus funds might establish grant programs, with grants awarded based on a combination of verified expertise ('Respect') and prospective votes, and with grantees tracking their contributions over time.

_Conclusion_
The above model is flexible, allowing custom dimensions to capture the unique strengths of contributions and contributors. These ratings could create a multidimensional, hierarchical information landscape that can be filtered for each user’s needs. It could also serve as a high-signal training ground for AI, while retaining collective control and value within the community.

Our model is scaleable and autonomous, making it a candidate for disrupting antiquated institutions like academia and politics. Reviews are inclusive and rewarded, providing a needed incentive where existing peer review and participatory democracy platforms have fallen short. Reviews are also inclusive, guarding against replication of systemic biases we see elsewhere (e.g. decentralised networks). 

Finally, our core model is simple and adaptable, making it suitable for diverse communities (e.g. open science, open source, charities, artists, etc) who can then agree to share value across their borders. Contributors might build up tokens in one community (e.g. open source) and spend them in another (e.g. arts festivals), or express gratitude for an entire project (e.g. a core resource), with tokens being split automatically between contributors.

### _Describe why you think you're qualified to work on this_
_Include references if you have them, but don't worry if you don't. Max 5000 characters_

For the past two years I’ve been leading Open Heart + Mind (OHM), a registered charity that hosts gift-based gatherings and uses these to prototype new models for community organisation. The framework here is the result of iteration over multiple OHM gatherings and reviews, having evolved from my initial scholarly publishing model to a general-purpose model for diverse communities.

So, the main reason I think I'm qualified to work on this is, well, I already am. But I also feel that the two decades prior to founding OHM have prepared me well for the journey ahead.

Design:

My first career was in architecture, but I became disillusioned with the industry and decided to travel the world instead. Today, I’m repurposing my creative problem solving skills to design a new ‘game’ for society, from the ground up.

Meditation:

I discovered a passion for the mind at a meditation retreat in Thailand and resolved to explore consciousness from all angles, objective and subjective. Meditation has since lead me to other mindfulness practices (e.g. yoga, dance), all of which help me to maintain balance as I manage OHM. 

Psychology:

I studied psychology, graduating top of both my undergraduate degree and honours thesis ([https://coopersmout.com/awards](https://coopersmout.com/awards)). Despite these accolades, the paper that resulted from this work was reviewed and rejected by multiple journals, wasting everyone’s time and delaying publication by two years. Even worse, I felt pressured to tell a particular ‘type’ of story (e.g., novel, significant) and was disheartened to realise that the system actually incentivises bias, gaming and questionable research practices. Since then, I’ve been using my knowledge of psychology to design new models that incentivise mutually beneficial behaviours and reward honesty.

Neuroscience:

I completed a PhD in the neuroscience of visual awareness, winning the Dean's Award and several other prizes ([https://coopersmout.com/awards](https://coopersmout.com/awards/)). My presentations ([https://coopersmout.com/talks](https://coopersmout.com/talks/)) and publications ([https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1144-3272](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1144-3272)) have taught me how to communicate complex ideas to broad audiences. At OHM, I’m using my experimental skills to design and conduct reviews and I expect my big data skills (machine learning, multivariate analysis, computational modelling) will become increasingly valuable as our system matures.

Free Our Knowledge:

During my PhD, I founded Free Our Knowledge (FOK) to address the collective action problem in academia and organise a critical mass of support for underused open science journals and practices ([www.freeourknowledge.org](http://www.freeourknowledge.org/)). I made lots of mistakes and learned a lot, embracing entrepreneurialism and a lean startup methodology. I completed the Open Life Science Leaders program and learned how to manage open source projects. Now that we have a working prototype for OHM, I plan to leverage FOK’s network to develop collaborations and test my hypothesis that our model will facilitate cooperation between projects.

Poker:

After my PhD I went ‘rogue’, playing poker to fund myself rather than compete against aligned projects. I’ve had a few big wins and used these to support my basic needs and projects since ([https://coopersmout.com/poker](https://coopersmout.com/poker/)). Poker has taught me how to embrace uncertainty, balance information streams and make calculated risks. It’s also added significant variance to my financial and mental stability, however, and so I’m now looking for a more stable income moving forward.

Compassion:

My other reason for leaving academia was to recover from burnout, caused by environmental and personal factors in my attempt to ‘win’ the game of academia. My subsequent recovery has been difficult but rewarding, as it equipped me with valuable tools (e.g., self-compassion) and the capacity to empathise with the suffering of others.

Community:

My healing journey brought me to festivals, where I’ve connected with a network of artists, musicians, healers and festival attendees. COVID taught me that this community and my scientific community were aligned in intentions but not opinions, and so I organised a gift-based festival for these communities to connect and learn from one another. I then realised we could use festival contributions as an analogy for research contributions in my scholarly publishing model, and thus OHM was born. In the two years since, I’ve been developing and prototyping the model, while learning to build community, host gatherings, administer a charity and manage the development of our bespoke app.

Metascience:

Last month I presented OHM at the Association for Interdisciplinary Metaresearch & Open Science conference ([tiny.cc/ohmAIMOS23vid](http://tiny.cc/ohmAIMOS23vid)) and we're now collaborating to develop another prototype, in which we will recognise and reward contributions to the AIMOS conference itself. I expect this will be the first of many such collaborations, as we develop the model and establish a network of aligned communities speaking the same fundamental language.

### How much money do you need?
_Feel free to give either a simple number, or a range, a complicated answer, or a list of what could be done with how much_

We would happily receive any amount you can give us. Our system is designed to handle all contributions, big and small, and distribute them to contributors, so our impact would scale with whatever you can afford.

We've spent part our first major donation ($50k) on gatherings and admin (see [https://opencollective.com/open-heart-mind](https://opencollective.com/open-heart-mind)), with the remainder earmarked for rewarding contributions to date, via our system (apparently this is called dogfooding, though I've no idea why). Any amount you donate would serve to incentivise future contributions and collaborations with aligned communities moving forward (e.g., by designating a pool of money to develop a prototype with another community, or to reward contributors to our app). If you were to give us $100k (which seems around your upper limit), it would show that we are growing while also giving us a chance to progressively scale with larger donations over time.

I'm also interested in exploring our system as an automated grants/reward system, for example collaborating with existing communities to recognise and reward core contributors retrospectively, or using our system to track new projects and automatically reward contributors (e.g., ACX grant recipients). In the future, I anticipate our system evolving into an automated grants program, where anyone can drop money into it, nominate their preferred field of interest, and the money gets automatically distributed based on crowd votes and other metrics within the system. If any of this sounds useful to your current or future grants, I'd love to discuss.

### Estimate your probability of succeeding if you get the amount of money you asked for
_Include your definition of "success" if it isn't obvious. Feel free to give a low number here, I understand that long shots at ambitious goals are also valuable._

My definition of success includes learning from failure, so I guess in that sense is 100%. Beyond that, it's difficult to put a number to this because it depends on what target we're talking about.

If the target is improving collaboration within communities, I'd say this is 100% because we're already doing this at OHM. Improving collaboration within other communities depends on whether they wish to adopt our system, which is difficult for me to estimate at this stage (though there seems to be interest in the AIMOS community, based on our new collaboration). Improving collaboration between communities is also difficult to estimate, because it depends on the degree to which they adopt our system and recognise other, aligned communities within our network. But discussions from project leaders in other communities lead me to believe there is great desire for something like this to help us all get on the same page and working toward a better future, together.

As for academia, I'm confident that this model, or something like it, will play a part in reforming academia. For me, it's not a matter of if, but when -- there are simply too many problems and inefficiencies with the current model for it to last much longer. The timescale of that disruption depends on how much support there is for systemic alternatives, like what we propose here. It might be that our model is not quite the right model and requires some extra features I haven't thought of. It might be that I'm not the right person to bring it to fruition. I do believe that our model is unique and novel, however, and so even if it is not the final model that causes disruption, it may inspire another model that does. Whether or not that future model is developed with OHM or separately, I would still consider it a success.  

I can also see our model playing a role in disrupting other institutions, like politics through participatory democracy. Here there's a lot more variance because I'm not as familiar with these systems. Similar to academia, however, I know there's similar frustration with the inefficiencies of these systems and so there's a clear hunger for change.

If you're looking for a percentage to calculate expected value, I'm sorry to disappoint. But I would also suggest it's near-impossible to calculate the potential upsides of the type of widespread, systemic change I'm proposing here. The best answer I can give that even if the percentage likelihood is ridiculously small, it would still be a gamble I'd take at the poker table.

### What's the most likely counterfactual if this doesn't get ACXG funding?
_Are you applying to other grants programs? Will you do a smaller version? Will it not happen?_

If we don't get ACXG funding I'll look into other options. To be honest, this is the first grant I'm applying to for OHM (our first donor found me via FOK, not the other way around) and it seemed like auspicious timing after just presenting our prototype at the AIMOS conference. If we're not successful here I'll look into other options, potentially some of those you mentioned in last year's grants retrospective. I'll be honest though, I'm an incredibly slow and meticulous writer (50+ hours time tracked for this grant application in our transparent workspace: [https://sharing.clickup.com/36615879/t/h/86cu75qh9/4RJ7ZFDVKJ7Y78X](https://sharing.clickup.com/36615879/t/h/86cu75qh9/4RJ7ZFDVKJ7Y78X)), so preparing another grant application would take me considerable time that I'd much rather put into developing our system.

I'm also looking for aligned individuals and communities to collaborate with, and suspect there's more potential synergy with someone who gives away their own money and experiments with a microgrants program than a charity board or other traditional funding mechanisms (but again, I haven't looked into this). Whether you fund OHM or not, I'm happy to chat about collaborations and potential synergies, e.g., with this microgrants program.

 
### Can I share your proposal, non-publicly, with other interested parties?
_This might involve passing it around to other potential donors and nonprofits looking for projects to fund. This requires zero work on your part and greatly increases the chance that it gets funded, I strongly recommend saying yes._

Yes

  
### Anything else I should know?
_Feedback about this process, etc._

Not that I can think of, but please get in touch if anything is unclear. I also just wanted to say thanks for doing what you're doing, I resonate with your attitude of putting your money where your mouth is and learning by doing. I look forward to hearing your feedback.

Society and communication

Modern society can be conceptualised as a social system of communication where the complex interdependence of the environment has been reduced to an arbitrary set of subsystems serving (supposedly) distinct functions (e.g., politics, education, science, law).    the aim is to reduce the complexity of the environment into a more manageable set of parameters. 

Modern society is compartmentalised into several subsystems with distinct functions (e.g., politics, education, science, law). 

These subsystems have evolved separately to develop their own languages, customs, norms and codes, obstructing communication between the subsystems. 

This inefficiency of communication leads to dangerous resonance effects when information is transferred across subsystem borders, such as when environmental science is misrepresented in the media and leads to political polarisation and inaction. 



These subsystems have 



Meta-communication

If communication is the transfer of information, meta-communication is the transfer of information about communication itself. 



1. Introduction to the problem
"Most communities have no fair, transparent, and incentive-compatible way to value contributions" -- SourceCred



Global systems are on the brink of collapse. We need to see rapid, systemic change if we're going to avert immense suffering in the coming years and decades. Commons-oriented communities (e.g., open source, open science, creative commons) offer a radical alternative to traditional capitalistic systems with the potential for exponential, systemic change. By generating public goods that can be re-used in perpetuity for free, these communities ... creating the potential for exponential change on a global scale.  movements have the potential to create widespread systemic change for .  there is a problem. Most commons-oriented communities



Most communities lack a fair, transparent, autonomous and evidence-based way to determine the relative value of contributions. Lacking such a mechanism, individuals are often incentivised to act in ways that are sub-optimal for the community and broader public. For example, in academia the relative value of contributions is often quantified using inappropriate metrics, such as the journal impact factor or H-index, which measure artificial 'prestige' rather than actual quality (BREMBS). In turn, this leads researchers to pursue suboptimal lines of research, engage in questionable research practices, not share alternative outputs like code or data, salami-slice papers, and devote their energy toward supporting privatised journal systems at the cost of free and open alternatives. Clearly, the academic community could benefit from a reliable system to quantify the relative quality of contributions, but as yet the growing number of platforms offering transparent crowd-based ratings remain under-utilised.



In academia, where quality is often evaluated using inappropriate metrics like the journal impact factor or H-index, researchers are incentivised to pursue suboptimal lines of research, engage in questionable research practices, keep data and code hidden, salami-slice papers, and devote their energy toward supporting privatised journal systems at the cost of free and open alternatives.

In the commercial sector, where numeric ratings have taken more of a foothold, users might be guided by 5-point 'star rating' that is nonetheless highly skewed and unreliable a a predictor of item quality (Rocklage, Rucker & Nordgren, 2021).

In the commercial sector, where numeric ratings have taken more of a foothold, customers might be guided by 5-point 'star ratings' on platforms like Uber or Amazon. Although these systems do offer a relatively inclusive review system, the resulting data tends to be highly skewed and thus unreliable as a predictor of actual quality (Rocklage, Rucker & Nordgren, 2021). 


Imagine a system that could calculate the value of any contribution to a community, relative to all other previous contributions, and reward the contributor with a token representing the value they brought to their peers.



we live in abundance; the main problem we see in the world today is one of sharing. 

sharing within and between communities could be facilitated with the development of a universal model that could reliably quantify the relative value of diverse contributions to the common good.

within such a framework, members of a community could contribute in their preferred manner, trusting that their contributions would be given fair recognition and reward. 

community members could provide honest feedback, trusting that their honesty would be rewarded and help to guide the quality of future contributions. Governance could shift into the hands of the crowd, reducing the need for administrative overheads and delays. 

experts within the community could be identified and given a platform 

looking globally, multiple communities could adopt the same framework, creating a common 'language' with which to communicate the relative value of shared contributions and learn from one another as each responds to new situations

Distinct communities, working in parallel to solve the same problem, could cease 'competing' for limited resources (people, money, ideas) and instead collaborate to solve the problem together.

Members could flow between communities, trusting that their previous contributions would empower them to continue giving in new contexts. 

new communities could form, tapping into the existing network much like a new mycelium network might merge with an existing, larger network in the same vicinity. 

in this way, diverse communities around the world could connect and communicate in a dynamic and evolving fashion, using the common framework as a reference point for the valuation of shared ideas, resources and actions. 



the first challenge in developing a system like this lies in the diversity of contributions. 



there are multiple challenges in developing a system like this...

3. Existing solutions
The development of the internet and more recently, decentralised technologies, have fostered a range of methods to quantify the value of contributions. In the sections that follow we will explore the strengths and weaknesses of these existing solutions with respect to measuring the value of contributions to a community.



Numeric ratings

The most common solution is a numeric rating on one or more dimensions of interest, for example the 5-point 'star rating' system used by many commercial businesses (e.g., Uber, Air BnB). This type of review system offers an easy, quick and user-friendly way to collect review data, while representing diverse qualities in a form that can be easily observed, filtered and analysed. Numeric ratings are often highly skewed (e.g., over half of products are given a 5-star rating on Amazon.com, REF), however, making them unreliable predictors of item quality (Rocklage, Rucker & Nordgren, 2021). These limitations could be due to many factors, ranging from reviewer dishonesty to biased sampling. Often times, companies pay reviewers or reward them in other ways, creating incentives to behave dishonestly. 



Peer review

In academia, where one might expect to see more honest, critical appraisals, numeric ratings remain underutilised. Indeed, the growing number of numerous models and platforms offer to rate papers have barely made a dint on the dominant paradigm of qualitative peer review. Thus, an additional challenge facing numeric rating systems is incentivising voluntary engagement. 



In academia, as in the commercial sector, reviewer data is rarely made available, limiting the transparency with which communities can... 

➝ open review



Meta-review 

Limited but increasing interest in meta-review within academia. Platforms such as XXX offer meta-review, where reviewers have an opportunity to review other reviews. This provides a degree of quality control in the review process, encouraging if not ensuring that reviewers provide fair, high-quality reviews. Qualitative meta-reviews are difficult to standardise.

➝ standardised meta-review



Rubrics

Rubrics are sets of instructions for grading items according to a transparent criteria (e.g., university assignments or applications to attend an event). Rubrics can increase the reliability, objectivity and transparency of evaluations (REF) and thus could serve some use in our idealised system. Due to their qualitative nature, however, rubrics are time-consuming to both create and employ. On the creation side, new rubrics would need to be created for every type of contribution, making them untenable for the type of diverse, flexible system we envisage here. Reviewers might also find them difficult to use, requiring a high degree of technical skill and/or expertise to use effectively. 



Token distribution

Decentralised technologies have brought forth a new wave of efforts to quantify the quality of contributions, which often employ some kind of blockchain token to represent value (e.g., Collaborape, Research Hub). Mathematically speaking, the distribution of a limited number of tokens is equivalent to making a fixed number of numerical ratings (or could be, after a simple normalisation procedure), meaning that token distributions are likely to suffer from the same limitations as numeric ratings (we know of little research into this subject to date). 



Moreover, token-based economics (or tokenomics) tend to suffer from an additional limitation: those with the most tokens have an undue amount of sway within the system. Since early adopters tend to come from priviledged populations, token systems may risk further perpetuating mainstream biases and power dynamics (REF: DisCO manifesto). Innovative solutions (e.g., quadratic voting , REF) may lessen this limitation but not resolve it entirely. There remains a need to balance early contributions (e.g., capital) with later contributions. 



In the political sphere, early steps toward participatory democracy... (Jonno's paper)

distribution of a limited number of tokens is equivalent to numerical ratings

problem of centralisation -- those who are doing the distribution are ultimately in control; risk of bias and corruption

quadratic voting as a potential solution (but still favours early adopters)

Here we present a novel idea that resolves many if not all of the above limitations...



5. Model Overview
Here, we propose a model that allows every member of a community to contribute in their preferred manner, while empowering the entire community to collectively determine the relative value of those contributions, and reward contributors accordingly. The core model (closed value loop) contains the following key stages (see also Figure X):



Create. Contributors make voluntary contributions to the community (e.g., ideas, actions, resources, art). 

Record. Community contributions are recorded in a transparent register of the community's choosing. The scale and scope of records depends on the community. Members are incentivised to keep the register current, complete and accurate. Gifts within the community are also recorded (see [7]).

Appreciate. Community members participate in a transparent peer review process to show appreciation for the unique qualities of each contribution. Reviews are comprised of pairwise comparisons: a simple, user-friendly task where reviewers vote between pairs of contributions on multiple dimensions of interest. Crucially, pairwise comparisons are also included in the contribution set, making them self-referential, 'closing' the value loop and incentivising reviews. 

Reward. Algorithms convert the reviews into a relative valuation for each contribution, benchmarked against pairwise comparisons as a standard unit of value. Tokens are distributed to each contributor based on their total contributions, minus any relevant costs. Surplus tokens can be paid forward in appreciation of other contributions (recorded on the register; see step [2]), used to lease community resources (see Radical Markets) or used in governance decisions (see Open Governance). 

Respect. Over time, key contributors are recognised and awarded a reputation score based on their demonstrated expertise. Reliable/unreliable reviewers are rewarded more/less generously for their reviews (e.g., 2 or 0.5 tokens per pairwise comparison, respectively). Reputation scores could also be used to weight governance decisions in favour of experts in the community. 

Pay-it-forward. Surplus tokens can be paid forward to other community members (for basic needs or other contributions on the register; see [2]), or spent on community projects, resources (see Radical Markets) or governance votes (see Open Governance). 

/0. Meet Needs. Community members can also meet their needs by exchanging tokens for community resources (where available). 



The core model is left intentionally simple, such that it could be adopted by diverse communities. In the following sections, we will go into each of these stages in detail. In later sections, we will expand on various extensions to the core model (e.g., governance, radical economics).



(For more information on how we are prototyping these principles at Open Heart + Mind (OHM), click the toggle "In the OHMniverse...").



5-1. Share and Create 
Contributors make voluntary contributions to the community.

The range of contribution types is infinite and depends entirely on the community vision, mission and values.

In this model, we focus on creative contributions, i.e., those that are 

Creative acts can involve a range of sub-contributions, such as ideas, resources and actions. 

To help guide contributions, we suggest that each community establishes a set of open source reference documents (e.g., Readme and Roadmap)



5-2. Record
contributions are recorded in a transparent register of the community's choosing

scope and scale of what is recorded depends on the community and it's purpose

can be beneficial to have a reference document (e.g., README), to determine which contributions fall within the project/community scope

the overall aim is to capture all energetic inputs (or as many as possible) that benefit the community

contributions can thus vary widely in scope, spanning ideas, actions, resources

contributions can be grouped into larger 'containers', such as an event consisting of many sub-contributions, which themselves may have sub-contributions

the method of grouping is up to the community, informed by past research (Open Analyses) and experience (see Open Processes)

Members can nominate their own or other members' contributions, with incentives for nominating novel, high-quality contributions and providing an accurate estimate of their value to the community

...



In the OHMniverse...



5-3. Appreciate
contributions are crowd-rated on one or more dimensions of interest

each dimension represents the crowd's appreciation of a particular quality, such as creativity or reliability. 

dimensions could vary widely, according to the values of each community

we suggest that the dimensions relate to values, decided collectively and defined in the community's core documentation. 

previous literature has stressed the importance of maintaining a common dimension between different instances of an evaluation framework, so that outcomes and measurements can be compared (Krieg). suggestion there was 'Desired impact', in reference to the academic audience of the model 

here, we suggest a more universal dimension that could apply to (practically) any contribution to any given community: appreciation. again, this dimension should be related to the core documentation, e.g., appreciation with respect to the community's core values and vision. 

as identified in the introduction, there are numerous ways that a community might collectively determine their appreciation for contributions. 

the novel aspect of our model is the use of paired comparisons, both as a unit of appreciation and a unit of value 



Pairwise comparisons 

the key feature of our model is the use of pairwise comparisons to rate contributions

individual reviewers are presented with two contributions and asked to show appreciation for just one of them, on each dimension of interest (Figure X)

for example, our primary dimension (Appreciation) may be surveyed by presenting two contributions and asking the review which contribution they appreciate the most. 

advantages

user-friendly

quick and easy to add meaningful data

inclusive (expertise not required)

minimal cognitive effort

simple model, open to analysis

standard unit for benchmarking

two algorithms: pairing and ranking

pairing algorithm selects the optimal pair for decreasing uncertainty in the system

this could depend on multiple factors (e.g., reviewer familiarity with the contributions, reviewer expertise, etc.)

ranking algorithm predicts the relative value for every contribution in the set, using ELO or more advanced Bayesian models



Closing the loop

the critical feature of our model is that pairwise comparisons are also included in the contribution set, providing a direct incentive to conduct reviews

in practice, this means that a reviewer could be asked to compare a pair of contributions, one of which represents one or more pairwise comparisons completed by another reviewer (Figure X)

this creates a 'unit of appreciation'. energetically, this represents the energy required to consider and express appreciation for the contribution via the review process

Since pairwise comparisons are orthogonal to the contributions themselves, this creates a second-order contribution 'type' that can transcend communities and become a common language with which to communicate relative values. 



In the OHMniverse...



In the OHMniverse...



5-4. Reward
review results are automatically converted into tokens that are distributed to contributors

this can be thought of as a 'gift' from the community, representing the positive energy in a form that can be paid forward (again), or used in governance decisions (see below)

tokens might also be subtracted from a users balance, in the case that they have attended a communal event with a fixed value



Benchmarking 

the inclusion of pairwise comparisons also creates a 'standard unit' with which we can benchmark the relative values of all other contributions 

pairwise comparisons are given a default value of 1 and all other contributions are benchmarked around this value

this value is fixed in the early stages of the community growth, on the assumption that all review data is equally valuable at this point

in the future, scores for individual pairwise reviews could increase or decrease based on multiple factors, e.g., how much data has been collected, reviewer reliability (more on this later), etc. 

also important to note that valuations are estimates only (non-fixed), because they can update with new information over time. This means that an under- or overlooked contribution could be given a more fair valuation, when more data comes in / the community realise how valuable the contribution really was with the benefit of time 

...feature makes the model recursive









In the OHMniverse...



What can contributors do with excessive tokens?

when paying forward tokens, the contributor should provide a justification within the open communication layer

limits corruption, encourages fair distribution of resources

crowd can verify valuation by ranking relative to other contributions

nominee (payee) might even be rewarded for accurate appraisal of relative value, creating an incentive to nominate contributors

important to note that contribution valuations are backdated, meaning that they can change with new information



In the OHMniverse...



Bootstrapping the system
Two goals:



generate a common unit of value between communities

In the early phases, we can make the assumption that all review data is equally valuable



can set a default value of 1 for each pairwise comparison





(OHM) Gatherings

Gatherings offer a discreet 'container' to generate an initial dataset, from which all other contributions could be benchmarked

could create a relatively uniform set of contributions, so that different communities could then compare contributions

new communities could kickstart their data collection with a new gathering



Model Extensions
In this section we outline some further implications that are not strictly necessary to the core model, but demonstrate some benefits and extensions to the model. 



(Respect and Govern. Key contributors are identified and given a reputation score within the system, which empowers them to have more influence in governance decisions within their field/s of expertise.)



Basic needs

Decay function

Open Algorithms
All code, data and processes are recorded transparently, making the entire system amenable to meta-scientific analysis and iterative updates based on dynamic feedback.



Qualitative evaluations
written reviews, figures, etc provide context to quantitative reviews



Quantitative evaluations
other types of quantitative evaluations, beyond pairwise comparisons, could be built into the system, e.g., numerical ratings, confidence intervals, token distribution, item ranking, etc. (see Krieg for more details)

pairwise comparisons might serve as a universal entry point to the broad community, once individuals have distinguished themselves as reliable reviewers they might be invited to participate in more detailed reviews, e.g., numerical rating of specific contributions within their field of expertise



Open Reputations
this section is more speculative/less refined

reputation scores in different fields (see Private for a starting point)

mention DAOs and limitations of best in class models? 

quadratic voting

limits abuse of power



Open Governance
Governance decisions are made by crowd-vote, whereby contributors with excess tokens can spend them in a quadratic manner to vote on particular issues ()





Meta-science
detecting gaming & transparent consequences

detecting bias

maximising outcomes of interest (e.g., joy)



Dimension ranking
the open evaluation & normalisation procedure results in a relative value for each contribution on multiple dimensions of interest

tokenising every dimension could have it's advantages (e.g., allowing people to spend/vote according to their strengths), but might also be overly complex, at least in the early days of community foundation 

alternatively, could collapse multiple dimensions into a single dimension, using a weighting algorithm

final weighting algorithm could be determined collectively, with every user having opportunity to set (and justify) their relative weights and taking group average



In the OHMniverse...



Transparent templates


Radical markets
collectively-owned goods could be leased using a Radical Market model



Tokenomics
multiple communities using variants of the same base token (NOM)?



Retrospective updates
negative updates could be absorbed by the system using donations where necessary (in cases where user not at fault), or charged as a cost (in cases of gaming, bias and cheating)



Model Characteristics
In considering the evaluation protocols above, we can identify multiple characteristics that an optimal evaluation protocol should embody (see also Table 1):



Scalable. The system would need to be highly scaleable to account for a diverse range of communities and their near-infinite range of contributions. 

Flexible. Communities have a near-infinite range of values, practices and outcomes. Our model will thus need to encompass multiple dimensions and be adaptable to the needs of each community. 

Dynamic. The system can be updated in line with new information and evolving feedback.

Inclusive (user-friendly). Estimating worth with respect to the entire community requires honest feedback from a representative sample of the community. To service and receive feedback from diverse populations around the world, the review protocol must be user-friendly and easy to understand.

Human-centred. Value is relative to the (human) community who benefit, so the system should be fundamentally based on human feedback from human agents. This is not to discount the use of artificial intelligence, but to place it in it's proper context and ensure that algorithms are fed high-quality data gathered from human agents (rather than the other way around).

Accurate. For a system to accurately reflect the opinions of the entire community, it should use unbiased sampling procedures at both the level of reviewer and contribution. Sampling at the reviewer level means that not every member of the community need be required to complete reviews, or at least the exact same reviews. The critical point in this kind of sampling is to ensure that the group of reviewers is sufficiently diverse to represent the broader community (i.e., a representative sample). Sampling at the contribution level... 

Trustworthy. ... the community would require a high degree of transparency, such that data, code, evaluations and outcomes can be openly interrogated. 

Closed (self-referential). In order for the system to be autonomous, it should be self-referential without the need for external motivators (e.g., payments for reviews) reference any forms of external value (e.g., fluctuating dollar prices). 

Enticing. Contributions, 

Universal. Common language... could be applied to any community that possesses: Contributors who make voluntary Contributions of variable quality on one or moreDimensions  of interest.

Transferrable. We envisage a common 'unit of value' that is universally applicable to diverse communities.

Critical Model Components





Use cases
A general-purpose model
Our model is general-purpose, in the sense that it could be adopted by any community who possess the following core elements:

Contributors, who make voluntary

Contributions  that vary in quality on one or more

Dimensions  of interest.



The model is also intentionally simple, such that it can be adapted for various purposes and expanded upon as each community sees fit. If each community adopts the core model and principles, they would begin speaking the same 'language' and thus be able to learn from one another as they grow and adapt to new scenarios (see Use Cases below for applicability to diverse communities, like academia and DAOs).

Academia
In stark contrast to current technologies, the vast majority of scholarly research is still published in traditional journals, using pipelines designed for the 18th century printing press. Many authors have noted that this status quo remains...



in the context of academia, discussions around openness usually focus on papers ('open access'), or sometimes data ('open data') and code ('open code')

although valuable, the focus on these public-facing contributions creates an incentive-gap, whereby other valuable contributions get overlooked and underfunded

our model aims to rectify these types of problems by recognising all contributions, not just those that are public-facing, e.g., tasks completed, meetings, internal communications, workshops, talks, conferences

...



(following section moved here from introduction)

Incentivising engagement (academia)

In academia, for example, there has been much discussion around replacing the traditional journal system with open numerical evaluation -- the idea that contributions (typically, papers) could be publicly rated by any member of the community (e.g., see Kriegeskorte, 2012). Models like this have the potential to disrupt the biased and privatised academic publishing industry (REF Brembs), returning control of the knowledge ecosystem to the public domain. Indeed, a large number of platforms have emerged in the past decade to offer numerical ratings of papers, including freely available preprints (REF Asapbio). Nevertheless, these platforms remain largely unused in the face of powerful incentives to support more 'prestigious', traditional journals instead. Thus, the main challenge (in academia) is convincing researchers to spend their precious time and energy on reviews within a new system that lacks the prestige of more traditional outlets. This problem is particularly relevant for emerging and disadvantaged persons, who face additional pressures and increased risks of providing honest, open feedback.
