# OHM Roadmap

## 🌳 Annual Growth Cycle
Each year represents a full system cycle — a rhythm of shared learning, rooted in gatherings of the heart and shaped by collective inquiry of the mind.

| Year | Theme                 | Heart (cOHMunity)            | Mind (wisdOHM)                 |

## 🌒 cOHMunity Council Series 2025
A series of meetings exploring a new theme and use case for the WisdOHM System each new moon cycle — using OHM Gathering (OHMG) as a live case study. These monthly Councils are open to everyone, and are supported by focused weekly meetings throughout the month.

## 🔁 Weekly Growth Cycle
Within each monthly Council theme, we move through a full WisdOHM cycle — not just in thought, but in practice. We begin by recording what’s emerging. Then we evaluate, reflect, and report what we’ve learned. These four phases repeat each moonth — simple, steady, systemic — and weekly meetings are open to those who can commit to attending all four sessions within the cycle.

| Week | Phase    | Example Tasks                                     |
|------|----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Record   | Nominate people, projects, contributions          |
| 2    | Review   | Value and metavalue contributions                 |
| 3    | Recognise | Analyze patterns, surface insights               |
| 4    | Reflect   | Communicate outcomes, tell the story             |
