## üîÅ Weekly Roadmap: Seed Council Series May 2025
Within each monthly Council theme, we move through a full WisdOHM cycle ‚Äî not just in thought, but in practice. We begin by recording what‚Äôs emerging. Then we evaluate, reflect, and report what we‚Äôve learned. These four phases repeat each moonth ‚Äî simple, steady, systemic ‚Äî and weekly meetings are open to those who can commit to attending all four sessions within the cycle.
