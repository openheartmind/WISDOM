# OHM Roadmap

## üå≥ Annual Growth Cycle
Each year represents a full system cycle ‚Äî a rhythm of shared learning, rooted in gatherings of the heart and shaped by collective inquiry of the mind.

## üåí cOHMunity Council Series 2025
A series of meetings exploring a new theme and use case for the WisdOHM System each new moon cycle, using OHM-Gathering as a case study. Building up to OHM Gathering (OHMG) at the end of the year.

## üîÅ Weekly Growth Cycle
Within each monthly Council theme, we‚Äôll move through a full WisdOHM cycle ‚Äî not just in thought, but in practice.

Like tending a growing tree, we begin by observing and gathering. Then we evaluate, reflect, and share what we‚Äôve learned.

These four phases repeat each moonth ‚Äî simple, steady, systemic.

| Week |  Phase      | Example tasks      | 
| ---  | ---         | ---                |
| 1    | Record      | Nominate people, projects, contributions |
| 2    | Review      | Value and metavalue contributions    |
| 3    | Reflect     | Analyze patterns, surface insights   |
| 4    | Report      | Communicate outcomes, tell the story |
