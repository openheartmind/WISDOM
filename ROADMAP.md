# OHM Roadmap

## üå≥ Annual Cycle
Each year represents a full system cycle ‚Äî a rhythm of shared learning, rooted in gatherings of the heart and shaped by collective inquiry of the mind.

## üîÅ Weekly Cycle: Seed Moon
Within each monthly Council theme, we move through a full WisdOHM cycle ‚Äî not just in thought, but in practice. We begin by recording what‚Äôs emerging. Then we evaluate, reflect, and report what we‚Äôve learned. These four phases repeat each moonth ‚Äî simple, steady, systemic ‚Äî and weekly meetings are open to those who can commit to attending all four sessions within the cycle.

| ID | Meeting | Phase     | Objectives                            |
| -- |--------|---------------------------------------------------|---|
| 1a | May 5  | Record    | Invite cOHMunity to nominate values. Select set of 10 for review, build prototype |
| 1b | May 12 | Review    | Invite cOHMunity to review. Reward reviews immediately. Close prototype when completed |
| 1c | May 19 | Recognise | Analyze data, generate rank-order of value. Identify improvements for next cycle. |
| -- | (prior to Council) | Reflect | Share outcomes and invite to next council via newsletter  |
