# OHM Covenant
*A shared commitment to fairness, care, and collective contribution*

## 1. Welcome
Open Heart + Mind (OHM) is a community of researchers, artists, developers, and community leaders exploring new ways of living, working, and relating together. By participating in the OHM community ("cOHMunity") or using the WisdOHM app, you are joining a collective experiment in open collaboration and fair recognition of value.

This Covenant outlines our shared purpose, values, and expectations. By engaging with WisdOHM or contributing to OHM, you agree to uphold these principles.

## 2. Our Purpose
We aim to co-create regenerative, participatory, and transparent systems that support the commons and empower communities to coordinate with care, integrity, and autonomy.

## 3. Our Vision
We envision a globally distributed network of autonomous communities, coordinating their efforts through open, composable valuation and governance mechanisms. These systems empower people to contribute freely and to be fairly recognized and rewarded for the value they bring to one another and to society.

## 4. Our Mission
To realize this purpose, we are developing WisdOHM —- an open-source tool for decentralized valuation —- and contributing to the broader Metavaluation framework in collaboration with aligned communities around the world.

These tools empower communities to record and assess diverse contributions, helping to recognize what matters, reward what supports the collective good, and build more transparent and inclusive systems of coordination.

## 5. Our Values
OHM is inspired by the Open Science, Burning Man and Permaculture movements. In May 2025, we ran a collective "value mapping" experiment to identify the most important values to our community with respect to achieving the OHM mission. The top 10 values selected by the cOHMunity were:

1. Integrity
2. Consent
3. Regeneration
4. Care
5. Respect
6. Transparency
7. Decentralization
8. Community
9. Creativity
10. Gifting

You can read more about our value mapping methodology and process in our [Values wiki](https://github.com/openheartmind/cOHMunity/wiki/Values). We welcome ongoing dialogue about how our values guide our practices, and will continue to iterate on this list as our system and project evolves to serve our collective purpose, vision, and mission.

## 6. Participating in OHM
We welcome contributions of all kinds that advance the OHM mission—technical, creative, emotional, logistical, or relational. These may include:
- Developing or improving software
- Facilitating gatherings or care practices
- Coordinating or administrating projects
- Creating art, research, or documentation
- Offering feedback, mentorship, or financial support

We recognize that value comes in many forms, and we are working to honor them all.

Participation is always voluntary. We encourage you to contribute freely, without expectation of return—while trusting that our systems are evolving to recognise and reward contributions over time.

## 7. Using WisdOHM
WisdOHM is our open-source tool for recording and valuing contributions. Community members can:
- Nominate their own or others' contributions
- Review contributions through pairwise comparisons
- Earn recognition for their reviews and other contributions

All contributions are evaluated across multiple dimensions (such as "Gratitude", "Value to the Mission", and "Value to the Community"), harnessing the wisdom of the crowd to produce a collective representation of relative value.

In line with our accountability principle, members may also record resource-extractions—such as payments received, or other benefits—and other 'negative contributions' that detract from the mission or community—such as violations of our Code of Conduct—by emailing admin[at]openheartmind.org

## 8. Feedback and Disagreement
If you feel a contribution has been misrepresented, undervalued, or unfairly judged, we encourage you to:
- Submit feedback through community channels
- Join the valuation process to influence outcomes
- Contact project administrators in sensitive cases

All data should be interpreted with care, humility, and a spirit of continuous improvement.

## 9. Rewards and Reputation
Valuation data may be used to generate reputation metrics, based on net contributions over time. These scores may inform governance roles or access to shared resources. However, they are not absolute and should not be treated as measures of personal worth.

Some participants may also receive financial or symbolic rewards in the future, based on community valuation. This part of the model is theoretical and subject to change. Participants should contribute freely, without expectation of return.

## 10. Respect and Accountability
We strive to foster a culture where everyone feels heard, valued, and supported.

**Our Pledge:**

We as members, participants, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

All members of our community are expected to:
- Treat others with kindness, empathy, and integrity
- Honor diverse identities, experiences, and viewpoints
- Refrain from harassment, abuse, or discriminatory behavior
- Give and receive feedback with care
- Take responsibility for mistakes and seek to repair harm

These expectations apply in all community spaces—online and offline—and extend to all uses of the WisdOHM platform. For behavioral standards, reporting procedures, and enforcement guidelines, please see our [Code of Conduct](link-to-code-of-conduct).

## 11. Agreement Clause
By participating in OHM or using the WisdOHM platform, you agree to:
- Uphold this Covenant
- Abide by our Code of Conduct and its enforcement mechanisms
- Contribute in good faith and with care for others
- Accept that contributions and other interactions may be evaluated by the community
- Provide or receive feedback in a respectful, constructive manner

Your participation signals a commitment to building a shared culture of fairness, inclusion, and mutual respect.

## 12. Questions or Concerns?
If you have questions, need support, or wish to report harm, please email admin[at]openheartmind.org

## 13. Revision and Stewardship
This Covenant is a living document. We aim to provide reasonable notice of substantial changes when practical, but reserve the right to modify this document at any time without notice. Continued participation in OHM or use of WisdOHM after any modifications indicates your acceptance of the modified Covenant.
