### Meta-bits

In computing, a bit is the smallest piece of information possible. It represents a 1 or a 0, On or Off, TRUE or FALSE. 

In WISDOM, a meta-bit is the smallest piece of meta-information available. We are interested specifically in the relative value of information, as voted on by users under WISDOM. 

A meta-bit thus represents a single vote between two contributions, by a single user, about a single dimension of interest. Meta-information includes:

- the two piece of information (i.e., contributions) in question
- the dimension of interest (e.g., gratitude)
- the user who voted
- the outcome

Meta-bits can be thought of as a 'relative bit', in that the information is binary but in relation to two other pieces of information. 

Other useful information could reference the version of WISDOM under which the data was collected, e.g.:

- WISDOM framework version
- implementation versions (e.g., pairing algorithm, analysis algorithm etc)
- the community of the contributors / contributions
