# Governance under WISDOM

We're developing a novel framework where community members can earn a reputation by contributing value to the community, which then earns them a bigger influence over collective votes on important issues. Because WISDOM tracks and assigns value to all contributions, we can build a representation of each person's expertise (or experience points) across different projects (e.g., hOHM Base), fields (e.g., music) or combinations thereof (e.g., music at hOHM Base). This representation could be visualised as concentric rings, with the inner-most ring representing a 'circle' of the most experienced contributors (e.g., 2 people) and outer rings including newer contributors with fewer verified contributions. We're calling this model the WISDOM Tree, by analogy to the growth rings that show the age of a tree when dissected. Each community who adopts this model could be visualised as a tree in a forest, with the trunk representing their core community and branches representing each project or sub-community. This analogy only goes so far, because in contrast to a physical tree, our model is infinitely filterable and can therefore be dynamically updated at the click of a button. But hey, that's why we love data at OHM.
