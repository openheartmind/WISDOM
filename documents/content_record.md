# Content Record
This document is intended to collect written content created for the WISDOM project. Anything can be recorded here, for example conference proposals, pitches, website text, grant applications etc. Place newer contributions at the top. Just use three hashes to create a new title for the context (### Example title), and four hashes to create subheadings if required (#### Example subheading). You can link by highlighting the relevant text and pasting.


### Edge City Demo Day
The Weighted Information Schema for Distributed Open Merit (WISDOM) is an open science framework that empowers communities to self-evaluate the quality of diverse contributions. It features a user-friendly, open peer-review protocol with direct rewards for feedback, thus incentivising engagement. The key innovation is the use of meta-reviews to quantify the relative value of reviews themselves, which are then used to generate relative valuations for all recorded contributions, given in standard units equivalent to the value of a single review. 

WISDOM is free and open source, can be adapted to a wide variety of use cases and values, and generates data that may be useful for autonomous reward and governance by communities at Edge City. In this presentation, I'll introduce the model, give a live demo of our spreadsheet prototype and proof-of-concept web app, then close with an invitation to ideate and collaborate.

WISDOM: Autonomous value recognition and reward for self-organising communities
In collaborative efforts, how do we ensure that every contribution is properly valued and every voice is heard? The Weighted Information Schema for Distributed Open Merit (WISDOM) is an open science framework for recognising the value of diverse contributions through open peer-review. It features an inclusive review protocol where every review is directly rewarded, incentivising engagement. Reviews are then weighted according to open source algorithms trained on meta-review data, resulting in a crowd-level representation of the unique qualities of every contribution. This rich dataset can then be filtered in a myriad of ways, generating automatic rewards for contributors and reputation metrics for merit-based governance.

### Cooper's homepage
WISDOM (Weighted Information Schema for Distributed Open Metrics) is an open review framework designed from first principles to revolutionise the way we recognise and reward contributions. It began life as a disruptive scholarly publishing model and evolved through active experimentation at Open Heart + Mind to become a generalizable framework for diverse, self-organizing communities. By creating a fair, transparent system for recognizing and rewarding all forms of contribution, WISDOM empowers contributors and connects diverse communities with aligned goals.

At the heart of WISDOM is an inclusive review protocol that earns reviewers immediate rewards for their reviews, which are converted into group-level estimates of the relative value of contributions. Contributors can then be directly rewarded for the value they provide, and respected for their proven expertise and reliability. The entire process is open, decentralized and autonomous, ensuring everyone can participate, while guarding against bias and cheating through a self-reflective meta-review process.
