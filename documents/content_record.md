## ZuGrama Buildathon (Group code: NJzmFJRU)

#### Fast forward 10 years. What would you have achieved that you would consider impactful, either personally or for the world? How would you like ZuGrama to help you achieve this vision?
In 10 years, I envision WISDOM as a foundational framework for empowering the commons and fostering a thriving gifting economy. It will enable diverse communities to fairly evaluate contributions, share resources equitably, and make decisions rooted in collective expertise. ZuGrama could act as both a testing ground and exemplar, embedding its mission into WISDOM, optimizing for its values, and empowering contributors to drive equitable, values-aligned collaboration and resource sharing.

#### What is an area of technology or science that you believe is underexplored but holds immense potential for human flourishing? Describe how you would start investigating this area if you had unlimited resources.
Contemplative AI: training agents on value-aligned data to embody mindfulness and wisdom. With unlimited resources, I would fund diverse communities to record and value their activities via WISDOM, and also fund research into training AI on these datasets. I would create an autonomous, value-based grants program aimed at creating an interoperable network of wise, conscious AI, who can collaborate to solve complex problems while enhancing human flourishing and well-being.

#### Describe a complex problem you’ve worked on recently. How did you approach it, and what frameworks or methods did you use to break it down and find a solution? (Optional)
For the last 6+ years, I’ve been working on the collective action problem keeping researchers locked into traditional journals. Initially, I researched alternative models and built a collective action platform to motivate their support. Realizing this approach was too slow, I pivoted to design WISDOM from first principles and prototyped by hosting gift-based festivals. We then validated for academic use at open science conferences, demonstrating its potential for widespread systemic change.

#### What is the problem statement you want to work on? (Please write the problem statement (You can pick from exisiting list) or provide your own (but within these fields); Please describe your solution if you have one already.)

1. Impact-driven Funding – How can a decentralized funding system prioritize the impact and effectiveness of projects rather than relying solely on majority voting?
2. Community Utility Tokens – Develop a token framework that allows decentralized communities to manage shared resources and incentivize participation effectively
3. Governance Mechanisms – What governance structures can enable ZuGrama to scale effectively while maintaining its philoslophy?

WISDOM addresses these challenges by leveraging transparent, inclusive, community-driven valuation. It quantifies contribution value through controlled pairwise comparisons, prioritizing project impact over popularity. Pairwise comparisons, as the base unit of value, are rewarded immediately, fostering participation and enabling fair distribution of resources via tokens linked to contribution value. Reputation profiles track sustained value over time on community-defined dimensions, enabling scalable governance in line with core values.

## Max Impact with Jimi Grow
### What's your personal bio? 
Dr Cooper Smout is a designer, researcher and lifelong student of human behaviour. Inspired by a Vipassana meditation retreat, he left a promising career in architecture to study Psychology and Neuroscience at the University of Queensland, winning prizes for both his Honours and PhD theses in the neural mechanisms of visual awareness.

Cooper’s passion for good design found a counterpart in the scholarly publishing industry, igniting a new interest in Open Science and the problem of cultural change in academia. He founded the world’s first collective action platform for researchers (Free Our Knowledge) and spent several years campaigning for open and reproducible research practices, later drawing on these experiences to design a decentralized peer-review model with disruptive potential. Realising he could make faster progress outside of academia, he founded a citizen-science project (Open Heart + Mind) and prototyped by peer-reviewing contributions to community gatherings, before validating the model for use in academia by peer-reviewing contributions to Open Science conferences. 

Alongside these pursuits, Cooper enjoys playing games, snowboarding, rockclimbing, meditating, and dancing, and dreams of one day of belonging to a network of interconnected permaculture communities all coordinating their efforts to regenerate the planet.   

### Tell me a bit bout your company
Open Heart + Mind (OHM) is a volunteer organisation dedicated to exploring radical models for society based on Open Science principles of sharing, transparency, fairness, equity, diversity and inclusion. Since co-founding in 2022, we’ve partnered with a registered arts charity and co-created a diverse range of community gatherings, using each opportunity to prototype a new model of collective valuation through open peer-review of contributions. Through this collaborative process, OHM has developed WISDOM, an open source meta-research framework that empowers communities to collectively value their own contributions in standard units, on dimensions reflecting their values, so that they can reward contributors quickly and fairly, share resources effectively and coordinate with aligned organisations. We’ve prototyped this model successfully in a range of communities spanning the arts, science and technology sectors and are now building an MVP to scale the model to diverse communities around the world. Our first use case will be back-valuing all of the recorded contributions to OHM since we founded, including a $50k donation, so that we can recognise contributors with reputation metrics and reward them with a fair share of any spare resources available to the community. In doing so, we aim to test the theory that this will create a self-reinforcing feedback loop, or ‘virtuous cycle’, which can be replicated in diverse communities and facilitate coordination between aligned organisations. 


## Astera Residency application
### Describe the problem you expect your residency to focus on and your proposed solution or direction for identifying a solution. Aim for a level of explanation that a smart college freshman could understand. (3000 characters max)
The open science movement faces two critical challenges: coordination and adoption. Despite shared goals, efforts remain fragmented and underutilized, limiting their collective impact. For example, at least 37 preprint review platforms compete for limited resources, while remaining underutilized compared to journals. Similarly, most open science communities operate in near-isolation. These fragmented efforts could be more effectively united under a common recognition framework, but no existing system can efficiently determine the relative value of diverse contribution types across different platforms and communities.

WISDOM (Weighted Information Schema for Distributed Open Merit) addresses these challenges by providing a flexible framework for valuing diverse contributions with respect to common goals and values. The core protocol is simple and inclusive: community members choose between pairs of contributions on multiple dimensions of interest and are rewarded for each comparison with one unit of value. Votes are aggregated to produce multidimensional, crowd-level scores for each contribution, which are also awarded to contributors. By gamifying the experience with fun and fast rewards for all contribution types, WISDOM incentivises engagement in supported communities. 

WISDOM’s key innovation is using pairwise comparisons as a fundamental unit of value to scale all other contributions. This is achieved via meta-comparisons – embedding batches of comparisons into the process – then using algorithms to scale valuations. By generating standardized metrics pegged to a replicable process (pairwise comparisons), WISDOM helps communities determine fair contribution value and allocate resources effectively (e.g., via automated grants programs). By allowing diverse communities to recognise shared resources like public goods under the same framework, WISDOM allows individuals to stack rewards from multiple communities and thus incentivises the creation of public goods. 

During the residency, I propose to:
- Build open source infrastructure and integrate with key open science platforms
- Create standardized APIs enabling value and reputation transfer between projects
- Design and validate algorithms for generating reliable reputation metrics
- Conduct rigorous testing of scalability and resistance to gaming
- Prototype implementation in Web3 technologies

This will create a coordination layer enabling open science projects to:
- Measure progress toward goals with standardized metrics
- Highlight hidden contributions and reward contributors based on value created
- Share reviewer pools and reduce duplicated effort
- Transfer and aggregate reputation metrics across platforms 
- Generate empirical data about which approaches work best
- Cooperate effectively while maintaining independence

This will enable WISDOM to unite fragmented efforts toward a more cohesive open science movement. It may also have additional applications in other domains facing similar challenges.

### Why did you pick this problem to work on? What’s novel about it?
During my PhD, I became aware of misaligned academic incentives and realized my time would be best spent trying to disrupt the journal industry. I founded Free Our Knowledge (FOK) to coordinate the adoption of open peer-review platforms, concluding that (a) many projects were failing to coordinate, and (b) we needed direct rewards to incentivise reviews. I felt that both problems might be solvable if open peer-review could be standardized and expanded to cover project contributions and reviews themselves, and dedicated my time to solving this problem due to the high expected value, even with a marginal likelihood of success. 

This problem is novel in that it is fundamental to practically every sector of society. Open science is but one part of the broader global commons, to which it is intimately interconnected. Solving this problem could thus lead to knock-on effects in other sectors facing similar collective action problems, such as the environmental and cultural commons.
Why are you the right person to move your project forward?
My unconventional path has prepared me to develop WISDOM. I learned first principles design through architecture, cognitive bias through psychology, and complex information systems through neuroscience, all of which prepared me to design WISDOM and analyze its data appropriately. As a successful high-stakes poker player, I learned to balance risk and reward, contributing winnings to open science and demonstrating my commitment to the vision. Through FOK, I learned entrepreneurialism and open source management, while building a network of open science advocates for WISDOM.
I founded Open Heart + Mind (OHM) and prototyped WISDOM by hosting inclusive, gift-based gatherings, transforming a theoretical model and personal project into a functioning system and registered charity. My evolution from independent researcher to effective leader showcases my ability to scale projects, while integrating the diverse skills of system design, community building, and rigorous analysis.

### What assumptions about the future of science and technology are baked into your proposal? What are the ways in which those assumptions are most likely to be wrong?
WISDOM is designed from first principles, avoiding reliance on critical assumptions about the future of science and technology. While it assumes certain trends, it doesn’t depend on them and can enhance them regardless of direction.
1. Science will become more distributed and complex, with increased participation from global citizen scientists. WISDOM supports this by enabling anyone to contribute through simple pairwise comparisons, earning rewards for valuable review data.
2. Most actors are committed to knowledge creation. WISDOM reinforces this by rewarding valuable contributions and allowing the community to detect bad actors via open metrics, who may be expelled or given a ‘bill’ representing their detracted value.
3. Diverse communities will accept the idea of quantifying values like gratitude – perhaps my most flawed assumption, given limited levels of resistance at OHM (less so at AIMOS). For this reason, we will validate the model in open science communities before expanding elsewhere.
Why isn’t this problem likely to be adequately addressed (at this stage) by academia, government, or industry?
The collective action problem in open science requires a new transformative model focused on the explicit recognition, reward and incentivisation of public goods, including reviews themselves. 

This problem is unlikely to be resolved within academia, as both academics and their institutions are tightly bound within the same multi-level collective action problem that has withheld progress since the internet was developed. Researchers also tend to be very busy, limiting the actions they can take outside of paid research hours. This problem is also likely too complex and intricate to be solved by governments, which lack the agility required to experiment with novel evaluation systems. It is also unlikely to solved by industry, which benefits fom existing revenue streams and favors proprietary solutions over open infrastructure. 

### Who do you envision using your residency’s outputs, and how?
Primary users include:
- Participants of open science conferences, community gatherings, or journal clubs, who may collectively value diverse event contributions
- Contributors to open science projects (e.g., preprint review platforms), who may rate diverse contributions to projects (e.g., administration tasks, code, engagement with the platform)
- Astera Residents and Open Science Fellows, who may collectively value contributions to their projects
- Funders, who may receive gratitude for their financial contributions, elevating their decision-making power
- OHM gathering participants, who may rate diverse contributions to our events
Once validated in these primary communities, we may extend WISDOM’s application to:
- Broader scientific communities to evaluate research outputs
- Open source projects for contribution tracking and reward
- Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) for reputation-based governance
- Commons-oriented communities (e.g., environmental groups)

### How long have you been thinking about this problem? How much progress have you made on it?
I’ve been thinking about this problem since 2016 and actively exploring solutions since founding FOK in 2018. I designed an open-rating model and prototyped one aspect at the 2021 eLife Innovation Sprint. In 2021 I founded Open Heart + Mind (OHM) to prototype WISDOM in the safer context of gifting festivals, then validating the model for academia by application to the AIMOS 2023 open science conference. We presented this data at AIMOS conference this week and have been invited by the president to explore integrations, such as rating conference proposals and pre-selecting preprints for review at MetaROR, the new meta-research review platform. I’ve also discussed WISDOM with other open science communities, including the Center for Open Science and PREreview, who similarly expressed interest in exploring integrations. 

Alongside these efforts, our team of volunteer developers have built a proof-of-concept web app (wisdohm.openheartmind.org) and drafted design artifacts for an MVP app.

### Do you have a history of involvement in open science or open-source projects?
Yes, I've been deeply involved in open science since 2018, contributing to open infrastructure and research papers on open science. Through FOK, I campaigned for open science projects over several years, then handed the project and open source infrastructure to a new board in 2023. Through OHM, we're making all WISDOM documentation, code, and data openly available. I’ve presented on FOK and WISDOM at over 30 international events, including several invited talks and panel discussions. 

In addition to this work, I’ve also contributed to and had roles in a wide range open science projects and communities, including:

- IGDORE member (2019-24)
- Open Science MOOC presenter (2019)
- Center for Open Science Ambassador (2019-2021)
- SIPS member / conference attendee (2019-24)
- AIMOS member / conference attendee (2019-24) 
- Open Life Science Leaders program (2020)
- eLife Innovation Sprint (2020)
- Access 2 Perspectives member (2024)

### How have you dealt with mistakes or failures in the past? Have you ever failed at something significant in a public way?
I've always focussed on turning mistakes and failures into opportunities for growth and learning. After a false start in architecture, I traveled the world and eventually discovered an interest in consciousness at a meditation retreat. I returned home to study psychology and neuroscience, but fell into depression following my disillusionment with academia. Rather than quitting, I returned to my roots, resuming a daily meditation practice and traveling to the Netherlands on a competitive scholarship. There, I founded Free Our Knowledge (FOK) and chose to prioritize it over an offer for my former ‘dream job’ –  a postdoctoral meditation researcher. After failing to get FOK funded through traditional means, I used poker winnings to self-fund it. While FOK didn't succeed as I had envisioned – my most significant public 'failure' – I’m proud of myself for trying and grateful for the lessons I learned, which strengthened my capacity to develop more comprehensive solutions through WISDOM.

### What is the most impressive (by your own judgment) thing you’ve ever done that would not be obvious from your LinkedIn?
Building Open Heart + Mind (OHM) from scratch as an introvert, while recovering from PhD burnout. What started as a safe space to prototype WISDOM grew into a vibrant community and charity, to which I was elected president. Following a lifetime of independent pursuits, including self-funding FOK through poker, I found myself thrust into the public spotlight with a community looking to me for leadership. I had never been in a leadership position before and only recently completed the open science leaders program, which focussed on online community and not real-world leadership. I’ve made mistakes in my newfound role, many of which have been public and painful for myself and others, but I’ve done my best to learn each time. Through this process, I’ve grown from being a fiercely independent overgiver into a more rounded leader who can set boundaries and focus on priorities and have witnessed the joy, connection and growth that this work has brought to hundreds of people in our community. 
What gets you out of bed in the morning?
- Gratitude for the many blessings of life, both big and small: the ability to breathe, and the opportunity to pursue my dreams with the support of loved ones who believe in me. 

- The dream of a gifting economy, where everyone has their basic needs met and can pursue their purpose without compromising their integrity or health; receiving fair recognition in the form of digitized values, which can be paid forward to others, in turn.

- Gratitude to finally have found my role to play in the puzzle of averting climate change, after searching for over 20 years; discovering a tractable path with which we can reclaim control of our information systems, so that we can work together and regenerate the environment.

- And finally, witnessing the effects of my actions as I walk this path; to see how OHM and the WISDOM project have brought gratitude, joy and connection to our diverse community in Australia and, increasingly, around the world. 


### What is the most exciting scientific or technical problem to you other than the one you described above?
The most exciting scientific problem to me remains the one I embarked on 15 years ago: understanding consciousness. I began my PhD aiming to use neurophenomenology to combine first-person phenomenological methods (e.g., trained introspection and meditation) with third-person neuroscientific measurements (Varela, 1996). However, I soon realized that academia is biased against these questions and shifted my focus to academic reform.
Nevertheless, I remain deeply fascinated by this idea and hope that WISDOM may one day facilitate such research through the autonomous distribution of research grants. Beyond creating new funding pathways, WISDOM might also advance consciousness research by generating high-signal datasets to train networks of aligned AI agents. These agents could represent both individual and collective values, enabling a richer understanding of consciousness at multiple levels.




## DeSci Grant
WISDOM: A Decentralized Framework for Community-Driven Value Recognition and Reward

#### Project Abstract (Max 300 words)
The Weighted Information Schema for Distributed Open Merit (WISDOM) is a radically inclusive, decentralized framework for autonomous recognition and reward of diverse contributions. WISDOM addresses fair value attribution in collaborative efforts, particularly in commons-oriented fields like open source, academia, and community projects.

At its core, WISDOM features a fast, simple review protocol based on pairwise comparisons, where reviewers choose between pairs of contributions on community-selected dimensions (e.g., gratitude). The key innovation lies in recognizing reviews as valuable contributions, rewarding them with a standard 'unit of value’, and using them to scale the relative value of all other contributions. This is achieved through meta-reviews, where reviews are embedded into the same review process and compared to regular contributions. Open source algorithms then convert these data into multidimensional scores for all contributions, with each unit representing the value of a single pairwise comparison. Critically, reviews are directly rewarded and never more complex than a simple pairwise comparison, incentivising feedback and maximizing the ‘wisdom of the crowd’ through diverse representation.

WISDOM encompasses six key processes: 
1. Record: Transparently documenting diverse contributions 
2. Review: Employing pairwise comparisons for inclusive evaluations and meta-evaluations 
3. Recognize: Generating multidimensional representations of contribution quality 
4. Reward: Distributing funds or tokens based on community-validated value 
5. Respect: Building reputation metrics for expertise and reviewer reliability 
6. Research: Conducting meta-research to iterate on the system

WISDOM has been prototyped at community arts gatherings and open science conferences, recognizing often-overlooked contributions and validating its inclusivity and adaptability to diverse populations. By standardizing contribution value across diverse fields and fostering a virtuous cycle of value creation, WISDOM aims to empower contributors, build trust, and connect communities through a dynamically-evolving, interconnected web of digitally-encoded values. 

#### What is the potential impact of your project on your field and society? (Max 200 words)
WISDOM has the potential to transform how value is recognized and rewarded across various fields and society at large. Its impact could be far-reaching:
Scientific Progress: By incentivizing open peer review and recognizing diverse contributions, WISDOM could accelerate scientific advancement and improve research quality.
Open Source Development: The framework could revolutionize how open source projects attribute value, potentially leading to more sustainable funding models for critical digital infrastructure.
Community Empowerment: By providing a transparent, inclusive system for recognizing contributions, WISDOM could strengthen community bonds and increase participation in collective efforts.
Meritocratic Governance: Reputation metrics generated by WISDOM could inform more equitable, expertise-based decision-making processes in autonomous organizations.
Economic Innovation: By creating a standardized "language" of contribution value, WISDOM could facilitate the development of new economic models based on gifting and actual value creation, rather than arbitrary metrics.
Cross-domain Collaboration: The framework's adaptability could foster unprecedented cooperation between diverse fields, connecting communities with aligned goals.
AI Training: By generating high-quality, values-aligned data, WISDOM could contribute to the development of more trustworthy and beneficial AI systems.
Social Equity: By recognizing and rewarding all forms of contribution, WISDOM could help address systemic biases in current value attribution systems, promoting a more inclusive society.

#### How could your project leverage blockchain, Web3, or decentralized infrastructures? (Max 200 words)
WISDOM is inherently aligned with decentralized principles and could leverage blockchain and Web3 technologies in several ways:
Immutable Record-Keeping: Blockchain can provide a transparent, tamper-proof ledger for recording contributions, reviews, and meta-reviews, ensuring data integrity.
Smart Contracts: Automated reward distribution based on WISDOM's algorithms could be implemented through smart contracts, ensuring fairness and reducing administrative overhead.
Tokenization: WISDOM's gratitude tokens (e.g., OHMnoms) could be implemented as blockchain-based tokens, facilitating seamless exchange within and between communities.
Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs): WISDOM's reputation metrics could inform governance structures in DAOs, enabling merit-based voting systems.
Interoperability: Web3 standards could allow different WISDOM implementations to communicate, enabling cross-community collaboration and value exchange.
Decentralized Storage: Technologies like IPFS could be used to store WISDOM data in a distributed manner, enhancing resilience and reducing centralization risks.
Self-Sovereign Identity: Web3 identity solutions could be integrated to manage user profiles and reputation across different WISDOM implementations.
Zero-Knowledge Proofs: These could be employed to verify contribution values or expertise levels without revealing sensitive information.
By leveraging these technologies, WISDOM can enhance its core principles of transparency, inclusivity, and decentralization, creating a robust, scalable system for recognizing and rewarding value across diverse communities.

### Talk title
WISDOM: An open value accounting framework for diverse communities


### Description
In this talk, I'll introduce WISDOM, an open value accounting framework that empowers communities to recognise diverse contributions and directly reward contributors for their efforts.

I’ll begin with an overview of the framework, showing how it began life as an open peer-review model and evolved through active experimentation to become a generalisable framework for diverse communities. I’ll highlight the key innovation: the use of pairwise comparisons as both an inclusive review protocol and a ‘standard unit of contribution’, which serve to peg the value(s) of all other contributions in a decentralised and autonomous manner.

I’ll demonstrate the framework’s adaptability by sharing data from diverse communities in the arts, science and technology sectors, before focussing on an academic use case where we used WISDOM to quantify the value of contributions to the two most recent AIMOS metaresearch and open science conferences. I’ll show how WISDOM (a) revealed community values and several contributions that might otherwise have gone unnoticed, (b) incentivised open peer-review, and (c) estimated contribution value on multiple dimensions of interest. I’ll highlight how WISDOM facilitates metaresearch by sharing results of several analyses we've conducted, then invite questions and suggestions from the audience.

I’ll close with a vision for how WISDOM can help connect diverse communities in the research space and beyond, along with an invitation to use WISDOM to review, recognise and reward contributions to ResBaz itself. 

### Workshop title
Reviewing, recognising and rewarding diverse contributions to ResBaz

### Description
The Weighted Information Schema for Distributed Open Merit (WISDOM) is an open science and meta-research framework for estimating the relative value of contributions to diverse communities. It features an inclusive review protocol and a decentralised, autonomous process to estimate contribution value, which can be used to recognise, reward and respect contributors for the value they create. 

In this workshop, we’ll learn how to use WISDOM to review and recognise diverse contributions to any community, using ResBaz as a working example. We’ll begin with an introduction to the prototype we used to review contributions to the AIMOS 2023 and 2024 open science conferences, showing how data moved through the model pipeline (Record, Review, Recognise, Reward, and Respect) and results of several other analyses.

Next, we’ll start work on the ResBaz Victoria 2024 prototype. Participants will be invited to nominate contributions and dimensions for rating via an online survey. We’ll edit the list of contributions and select a representative sample for review. We’ll discuss pros and cons of different rating dimensions, then choose a set of dimensions on which to rate ResBaz contributions. 

We’ll also aim to complete some reviews during the workshop itself, so please bring a laptop or tablet if you have one available. We’ll close the session with a round of reflections on the process, an overview of next steps, and an invitation to contribute further to the project. 



## IPFS Unconference intro
Hi I’m Cooper 👋 neuroscience PhD with 6+ years researching, developing and validating a decentralised collective valuation protocol that I think could be valuable for the IPFS ecosystem. Would love a vote on my proposal if you like the idea of a radically inclusive open peer review protocol with inbuilt incentive mechanism! 🥰

## Zu-Grama
### ZuGrama is all about cross-pollination of ideas, which fields of technology should intersect more and why? 
Open science and decentralised science (DeSci). I've been part of the Open Science movement for over 6 years now, and feel there are many lessons to be learned but very little contact between these fields. The DeSci movement could learn from the successes and failures in the Open Science space, where systemic change and disruption has been attempted for over 30 years with minimal success. The core problem remains one of culture, not technology, and there is plenty of research and relevant experience to be learned from. Conversely, the Open Science space could benefit from the technical proficiency and innovation in DeSci, but I rarely see DeSci projects represented at Open Science or Meta-research conferences. There is clearly an alignment there and I think a missed opportunity to learn from one another and become stronger by working together.   

### ZuGrama is co-built by all the participants. You’ll have the opportunity to create any session in ZuGrama’s permissionless bottom-up programming, what would you like to contribute and in what field? 
I would like to host sessions to introduce the WISDOM framework: https://github.com/openheartmind/WISDOM
https://openheartmind.org/research/

WISDOM is an adaptable framework for estimating the collective value of diverse contributions. It features an inclusive open peer-review protocol, direct incentive mechanism and open algorithms that automatically produce relative valuations for every contribution, on multiple dimensions of interest. 

I'd love to explore the framework with the Zu-Grama community, collecting open peer-review data and generating a relative valuation of contributions to Zu-Grama itself. This could then serve as a proof-of-concept for a decentralized 'template' to recreate Zu-Grama in the future, as well as a funding distribution mechanism and platform for governance.

At present, we have a working prototype that we've validated at both community arts gatherings and open science conferences. We're currently developing an MVP, however, and are expecting to have that ready for testing at Zu-Grama.   

### Fast forward 10 years. What would you have achieved that you would consider impactful, either personally or for the world? How would you like ZuGrama to help you achieve this vision?
In 10 years, I aim to have established WISDOM as a foundational framework for recognizing and rewarding diverse contributions across multiple domains - spanning open science, community projects and the Web3 space. The system would be empowering a global network of communities to fairly evaluate contributions, distribute rewards, and make decisions based on validated expertise rather than traditional hierarchies.   Key milestones would include:
* Proven implementation across 100+ communities
* Integration with major open science platforms
* Development of interoperable token systems between aligned communities
* Creation of robust reputation systems for expertise-based governance 
ZuGrama's Role: The village could accelerate this vision by:
* Providing a testing ground for WISDOM among diverse creators and technologists
* Facilitating connections with other projects working on decentralized governance
* Offering space to prototype and iterate on the framework with immediate feedback
* Creating opportunities to integrate WISDOM into the village's own decision-making processes

### What is an area of technology or science that you believe is underexplored but holds immense potential for human flourishing? Describe how you would start investigating this area if you had unlimited resources.  
Contemplative, values-aligned AI. I believe that much like meditation is beneficial for humans, building meditation-like processes into AI could be hugely beneficial for human flourishing and may help solve the alignment issue.   If we had unlimited resources, I would airdrop progressively larger amounts of money into diverse communities using the WISDOM system, creating a virtuous cycle in which contributors are directly rewarded for the value they create and are thus incentivised to maintain engagement.  These rewards could be targeted to incentivise research into contemplative, values-aligned AI. For example, we might conduct research into subjective measures of individual vs collective value, as an analogue for the meditation processes of emptiness and mindfulness. We might also recognise and reward those contributions that produce ‘higher-order’ states, like gratitude and joy.   The datasets generated by such a vast network of diverse WISDOM communities could then become a high-signal training ground for a complex network of values-aligned AI, which may collaborate to solve pressing issues and maximise human flourishing.   

### Applications can be tricky. If we were to ignore all the questions and answers, and you had the chance to tell us something that would make us want you at ZuGrama, what would it be?  
I've been trying to find my place in the problem of climate change for over 20 years now. This took me on a winding path through many disciplines, before having my heart broken by academia and finding salvation in the Open Science movement. Since then, I've been trying to kickstart cultural change in academia. Through prototyping at community arts gatherings, I believe I've now stumbled upon a general-purpose solution that can address all kinds of collective action problems in diverse communities, like Zu-Grama. I've poured my heart and soul into this project because I believe that a gift-based future is not only possible, but is absolutely necessary if we're going to come together and solve the incredibly complex problems we face as a global society. I believe a critical part of that journey will be connecting and empowering the global South, and I hope to forge new connections in India through the ZuGrama residency.   

### Did someone refer you?* 
I heard about Zu-Grama at ZuBerlin and have been following the Telegram groups since then. But can't remember who it was that mentioned it.   

### Is there someone you want to refer to ZuGrama?* 
Dipanshu Singh, dipanshuhappy@gmail.com, @agentDPS   

### How much financial assistance would you need and why? Give us a brief description how much assistance you need in dollars on why you need financial assistance.
I’m seeking a fully-funded ZuGrama Fellowship, as mentioned on the Zu-Grama Telegram. I've been self-funding my Open Science projects for over 6 years now. I was playing poker to support myself, but over the past year and a half have been focussing almost exclusively on the WISDOM project so that we can get these ideas out into the world and start connecting communities. I’ve poured everything I have into this project and would do it all over again, but systemic change is a slow process and radically different ideas take time to take root.    

### Describe a complex problem you’ve worked on recently. How did you approach it, and what frameworks or methods did you use to break it down and find a solution?  
The main problem I've been trying to solve for 6+ years is the collective action problem keeping researchers locked into the broken journal system. I began by researching alternative models, before realising that many alternatives already exist but people aren't using them. This lead to my first project, a collective action platform that organised conditional pledges as an attempt to solve the problem socially. I spent several years campaigning and researching the best models in the Open Science space, but eventually learned that this approach is too slow and we require a significantly better model to motivate change. 

I researched entrepreneurship and disruption, then went back to the drawing board to design a novel model from first principles that had all the necessary features for disrupting academia. I began pitching within academia, but realised I would need a safer environment to prototype rapidly, so left and founded a community where we hosted gift-based festivals and iterated on the model by peer-reviewing festival contributions, as an analogue for academia and other commons-oriented spaces. About a year later, I stumbled upon the current WISDOM model and realised that it solves many of the problems I has been thinking on for several years. 

We validated the model internally at OHM, then returned to academia to share the data and model at an open science conference, before using that conference as the next prototype and validation of the model.  



## Edge City Demo Day
The Weighted Information Schema for Distributed Open Merit (WISDOM) is an open science framework that empowers communities to self-evaluate the quality of diverse contributions. It features a user-friendly, open peer-review protocol with direct rewards for feedback, thus incentivising engagement. The key innovation is the use of meta-reviews to quantify the relative value of reviews themselves, which are then used to generate relative valuations for all recorded contributions, given in standard units equivalent to the value of a single review. 

WISDOM is free and open source, can be adapted to a wide variety of use cases and values, and generates data that may be useful for autonomous reward and governance by communities at Edge City. In this presentation, I'll introduce the model, give a live demo of our spreadsheet prototype and proof-of-concept web app, then close with an invitation to ideate and collaborate.

WISDOM: Autonomous value recognition and reward for self-organising communities
In collaborative efforts, how do we ensure that every contribution is properly valued and every voice is heard? The Weighted Information Schema for Distributed Open Merit (WISDOM) is an open science framework for recognising the value of diverse contributions through open peer-review. It features an inclusive review protocol where every review is directly rewarded, incentivising engagement. Reviews are then weighted according to open source algorithms trained on meta-review data, resulting in a crowd-level representation of the unique qualities of every contribution. This rich dataset can then be filtered in a myriad of ways, generating automatic rewards for contributors and reputation metrics for merit-based governance.

I'm the founder and President of Open Heart + Mind (OHM), a charity community creating diverse gatherings as a safe space to prototype transformative models for society. My passion project is WISDOM, an open review, recognition and reward framework designed to connect and empower diverse communities (see more on my projects page).

My career journey began in architecture, pivoted at a meditation retreat, and passed through and out the other side of a PhD when I realised that the academic game is broken. Since then, I've been playing a different kind of game to fund my dream of a fair open science system, where everyone gets to play (more on my journey here).

### About me
Hi, thanks for dropping by :)

My journey into academia began at a Vipassana meditation retreat in Thailand, where I discovered a previously unimagined depth to my own mind and resolved to explore consciousness from all angles – through philosophy, meditation, psychology and neuroscience. I returned home to complete an undergraduate degree in psychology and an award-winning honours thesis in cognitive neuroscience, before embarking on a PhD in the neural mechanisms of visual awareness. Partway through the PhD, I attempted to publish my first paper and was shocked to discover a highly inefficient scholarly publishing system that wastes time and resources, biases the literature and pressures researchers into compromising their integrity. I also realised that employment prospects are pretty grim in academia, throwing me into a state of disillusionment – if I carried down this path, would I be forced to compromise my scientific integrity to survive in academia? Did I really want to compete with friends and colleagues for too little funding? Was the system even capable of supporting the types of big questions I’m interested in asking? Everywhere I looked, I saw evidence of overworked and burned-out researchers, many of whom had decided to leave academia after years of chasing short-term postdoc contracts around the world.

This disillusionment, coupled with other life stressors at the time, threw me into a deep depression that lasted the latter half of my PhD (incidentally, mental health problems are rife throughout academia). Since graduating, I’ve been rebuilding my mental health and regaining balance, thanks in large part to self-compassion meditation, dancing, and finding hope in the open science movement, which aims to create a fairer system while opening the research pipeline to public scrutiny. Toward the end of my PhD, I joined the Institute for Globally Distributed Open Research and Education and founded a collective action platform that aims to help researchers reclaim control of academia and restore balance in the research ecosystem (Project Free Our Knowledge). After spending far too much time coming oh-so-close to winning funding for this project, I realised I could earn more money playing poker and decided to leave academia to self-fund instead. In 2021, I placed in a few good-sized tournaments and came second on the Australian Poker Tour leaderboard, validating my decision to go ‘rogue’.

I’m now devoting all of my spare energy to Open Heart + Mind (OHM), a community-turned charity where we’ve been testing and iterating on an open review model that I designed to disrupt scholarly publishing, before realising I needed a safer space to prototype. At the same time, I discovered the creative potential of Burning Man gatherings, based on gifting and decommodification principles, and realised this could serve as an analogue for academia and a safe space to prototype the types of radical models I was dreaming up. This work has brought new challenges, not least of all learning to become a leader and manage a community as a born-introvert and recovering perfectionist. I’m deeply grateful for the learning opportunities this project allows and for all the amazing humans supporting me on this journey to realise my dreams.

In between this work and playing poker to fund it, I try to maintain a healthy balance through music, gardening, dancing, meditating, rockclimbing and spending time in nature.

### WISDOM
WISDOM (Weighted Information Schema for Distributed Open Metrics) is an open review framework designed from first principles to revolutionise the way we recognise and reward contributions. It began life as a disruptive scholarly publishing model and evolved through active experimentation at Open Heart + Mind to become a generalizable framework for diverse, self-organizing communities. By creating a fair, transparent system for recognizing and rewarding all forms of contribution, WISDOM empowers contributors and connects diverse communities with aligned goals.

At the heart of WISDOM is an inclusive review protocol that earns reviewers immediate rewards for their reviews, which are converted into group-level estimates of the relative value of contributions. Contributors can then be directly rewarded for the value they provide, and respected for their proven expertise and reliability. The entire process is open, decentralized and autonomous, ensuring everyone can participate, while guarding against bias and cheating through a self-reflective meta-review process.

## AIMOS 2024
### Lightning Talk
#### WISDOM: An open science framework for community-driven value accounting
In this lightning talk, I’ll introduce WISDOM (Weighted Information Schema for Distributed Open Merit) and share data from our pilot at the AIMOS 2023 conference. I’ll begin with an overview of the model, showing how it can adapt to diverse use cases and facilitate the collective valuation of contributions according to community-selected values. I’ll highlight the key innovation: the use of pairwise comparisons as both an inclusive review protocol and a ‘standard unit of contribution’, which serve to peg the value(s) of all other contributions in a decentralised and autonomous manner. I’ll share data from our recent prototype, where we used WISDOM to recognise and reward contributions to the AIMOS 2023 conference. I’ll show how we empowered the AIMOS community to: (1) Record diverse contributions, including many that might otherwise go unnoticed; (2) Review contributions according to community-selected dimensions; (3) Recognise contributions for their diverse qualities; (4) Reward contributors for the value they provided; and, (5) Respect reviewers and contributors for their demonstrated expertise. I’ll present our major analyses and system upgrades, showing how this circular process of meta-research and iteration could produce a highly efficient, values-aligned research ecosystem. I’ll close with an invitation to nominate AIMOS 2024 contributions online and attend our follow-up hackathon, thus contributing to the latest iteration of the WISDOM experiment.

## Hackathon
#### Reviewing, recognising and rewarding diverse contributions to the AIMOS conference
The Weighted Information Schema for Distributed Open Merit (WISDOM) is an open science and meta-research framework for estimating the relative value of contributions to diverse communities. It features an inclusive review protocol and a decentralised, autonomous process to estimate contribution value, which can be used to recognise, reward and respect contributors for the value they create. 

In this hackathon, we’ll use WISDOM to review and recognise diverse contributions to the AIMOS 2024 conference. We’ll begin with a demonstration of our prototype for AIMOS 2023, showing how contribution data were processed through each stage of the model (Record, Review, Recognise, Reward, and Respect) and sharing our major learnings from conducting this research. 

Next, we’ll start work on the AIMOS 2024 prototype. Participants will be invited to nominate contributions and dimensions for rating via an online survey. We’ll edit the list of contributions and select a representative sample for review. We’ll discuss pros and cons of different rating dimensions, then choose a set of dimensions on which to rate AIMOS 2024 contributions. If our numbers permit, we may split into breakout groups to complete these tasks in parallel. 

We’ll also aim to complete some reviews during the hackathon itself, so please bring a laptop if you have one available. We’ll close the session with a round of reflections on the process, an overview of next steps, and an invitation to contribute further to the project. 




## README v1
Hi and welcome to the WISDOM system :)

We're developing a generalizable open scientific framework for recognising and rewarding contributions to the commons, so that we can empower contributors and connect diverse communities with aligned goals. 

### The Problem
Fair recognition and reward are central challenges in collaborative efforts, especially in commons-oriented fields like art, open source and academia. An ideal system should capture, recognise and reward the unique qualities of every contribution, fostering trust and incentivising engagement. 
Modern systems tend to be overly centralised, subjective, biased and/or unreliable, however, incentivising behaviours that reinforce the status quo rather than change it. More broadly, the use of incompatible systems limits the capacity for effective cooperation between organizations with aligned goals. 

### Our Solution
WISDOM is a flexible framework designed to crack the code of cultural change. By creating a standardised measure of gratitude for contributions, WISDOM aims to empower contributors and connect aligned communities in the pursuit of their common goals. 
At the heart of WISDOM is an inclusive review protocol that incentivises feedback about diverse contributions. This input is then converted into a multidimensional representation of the unique qualities of every recorded contribution. Contributors can then be rewarded with tokens representing the collective gratitude for their contibutions, which can be paid forward in thanks to other people in turn. Contributor expertise and reliability can also be expressed numerically, creating a platform for people who consistently deliver value to their community.
 
### Minimal Viable Model (MVM)
_0. Select Dimensions._ Communities can embed their values directly into the code by choosing the dimensions that contributions are rated on. WISDOM builds on previous [open evaluation models](https://doi.org/10.3389/fncom.2012.00079) that suggest a common 'primary dimension' can facilitate cross-comparison between communities. We propose "Gratitude" as the primary dimension because of its universal applicability and psychological benefits for communities of practice, but communities are free to choose any number of dimensions that reflect their values and particular use cases. 
_1. Record._ Contributions are recorded in a transparent register of the community's choice. The scale and scope of recorded contributions depends on the community, and members are incentivised to keep the register current, complete and accurate. 
_2. Review._ WISDOM uses pairwise comparisons to generate ratings at the crowd-level. Pairwise comparisons are a quick, simple and user-friendly review protocol, making them inclusive to diverse people irrespective of expertise or technical prowess. Anyone in the community can complete a pairwise comparison by voting between two contributions on each dimension of interest (e.g., "Which of these two contributions are you most grateful for?"). Reliable reviewers can also earn the status of '_meta-reviewer_', which entitles them to vote on the relative value of reviews themselves (termed a '_meta-review_'). 
_3. Recognise._ Pairwise comparisons are relatively uniform, meaning that we can treat them as a 'standard unit' of contribution and use them to scale all other contributions. We do this by including a range of review contributions (e.g., 32, 64, and 128 pairwise comparisons) in the meta-review stage and fitting a function to the resulting votes, then interpolating values for all non-review contributions (see _3. Recognise_ tab in our [pilot dataset](http://tiny.cc/tinyOHMresults)). The result is a numerical value representing the collective gratitude for every single contribution (see _Gratitude per contribution_ chart in our [pilot dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HS7HFa9y6PfF61_wTuCAbj9RTHe94VLXulS0pDYgtns/edit?usp=sharing)). Communities who include more than one review dimension can generate a multi-dimensional information matrix about each and every contribution (see _Contribution Qualities_ chart in our [pilot dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HS7HFa9y6PfF61_wTuCAbj9RTHe94VLXulS0pDYgtns/edit?usp=sharing)), which can be filtered to suit the needs of the user and their community.
_4. Reward._ Contributors can then be rewarded with tokens representing the collective gratitude for their contributions (see _OHMnoms per Contributor_ chart in our [pilot dataset](http://tiny.cc/tinyOHMresults)). Reviews are rewarded at the rate of 1 token per pairwise comparison (including all dimensions), and regular contributions are rewarded commensurate to the number of units on the Gratitude dimension (more complicated transfer functions could be explored in the future). Communities may agree to subtract common costs (e.g., the average cost of an event), leaving a balance that reflects each contributor’s total energetic exchange with the community (see _OHMnom Balances_ chart in our [pilot dataset](http://tiny.cc/tinyOHMresults)). Excess tokens can be paid forward to other people who the contributor wishes to thank in turn, forming the basis of an evidence-based gifting economy.
_5. Respect._ By measuring contributions over time, we can generate metrics reflecting reviewer reliability and expertise within the community. Reviewer reliability can be measured using a range of measures (e.g., test-retest reliability, internal consistency), and trustworthy reviewers can be elevated to the status of _meta-reviewer_ (see _Reviewer Reliability_ chart in our [pilot dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HS7HFa9y6PfF61_wTuCAbj9RTHe94VLXulS0pDYgtns/edit?usp=sharing)). Experts in particular fields and topics can be identified by tracking the value they add to that field over time (e.g., see _Expertise: Science_ chart in our [pilot dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HS7HFa9y6PfF61_wTuCAbj9RTHe94VLXulS0pDYgtns/edit?usp=sharing)). Collectively, these metrics could form the basis of a merit-based participatory democracy algorithm, in which votes are weighted according to each person's validated expertise in the topic of interest. 

### Replicate and Repeat
All of the above processes should be conducted transparently and shared with the community, so that everyone can learn and grow together. The final stage is therefore to replicate the previous materials, embed any learnings, and repeat the process again. 

### Principles and Features
- _Transparent_. Contributions and reviews are shared publicly, so you know what's going on behind the scenes.
- _Inclusive_. Everyone is rewarded for their unique contributions, including reviews, meaning that everyone can contribute in the way that works for them.
- _Replicable_. Open source and forkable, so you can stand on the shoulders of giants.
- _Accessible_. Our review protocol is user-friendly and cognitively simple, so that anyone can contribute meaningful data no matter their circumstances.
- _Collaborative_. Our crowd-based reward mechanism incentivises collaboration over competition.
- _Diverse_. Our framework is flexible, scaleable and can be customised to the needs of different communities.
- _Honest_. Transparent reviews and reliability metrics encourage honesty and guard against cheats. 

### A Generalizable Framework
WISDOM is designed to be maximally inclusive to all communities. The MVM above is the simplest model possible for capturing quantitative meta-information -- information about the relative value of information. There are of course more nuanced ways to conduct reviews, but all of these can be considered derivatives of the MVM and could be valued accordingly (e.g., by valuing a lengthy written review in an equivalent number of pairwise comparisons). Communities are free to develop their own extensions to the core model, ideally sharing these developments publicly so that other communities can also adopt those extensions that make sense for them (and thanking each other accordingly). 
Each community can then decide which other communities to cooperate and trade tokens with, by assessing their transparent processes and data and deciding (if necessary) a relative weighting for the respective tokens. Providing that all communities adopt the MVM we present here, it would create a fundamental communication layer both within and between communities that directly encodes gratitude and facilitates cooperation toward common goals.
By integrating the three key functions of _communication_, _economics_ and _governance_, WISDOM aims to become a complete 'community operating system' for practically _any_ community.
 
#### Communication
WISDOM generates multidimensional, quantitative metadata (data about the relative qualities of data) that can be filtered in an infinite variety of ways and communicated globally. By embedding community values directly into the codebase, we can generate data that reflects those qualities and create a high-signal training ground for trustworthy AI. In contrast, the vast majority of current AI systems are trained on web-scraped data from the internet, which is niaively biased at best, and actively tuned toward suboptimal values at worst (e.g., profit, division, attention). 

#### Economics
In contrast to modern society, WISDOM places economics downstream from information gathering and communication. Communities are free to develop their own process and name for their token/s. At OHM, we call our gratitude tokens OHMnoms, in reference to the delicious little treats that our members contribute to the cOHMunity (or alternatively, as shorthand for the _nom_inations their contributions receive). OHMnoms are calculated by applying a function to the meta-information matrix. The current version of the algorithm is very simple -- a 1-to-1 mapping of the Gratitude dimension -- meaning that OHMnoms are a direct measure of the collective gratitude for contributions. In the future, this algorithm may be developed to include more variables, but for now we're just keeping it simple.
Other communities are free to develop their own calculation method and name for their own token. Each community could then decide what other communities to cooperate and trade with, e.g., by assessing their processes and data and determining a relative weighting for the respective tokens (if necessary). Providing that all communities adopt the MVM we present here, it would create a fundamental communication layer both within and between communities that directly encodes gratitude and facilitates cooperation toward common goals. 

#### Governance
WISDOM can also generate a governance framework where community members earn the right to have more say in how the community is governed. By tracking the relative value of contributions over time, we can build a representation of each person's expertise (or experience points) across different projects (e.g., hOHM Base), fields (e.g., music) or combinations thereof (e.g., music at hOHM Base). Core contributors might then have more influence over the direction of the project or community, for example by weighting votes in a collective voting process. This results in a process where everyone can have their say and be heard, but we listen more to those people who have been validated as experts within the community. 
Experience points could be visualised as concentric rings, with the inner-most ring representing a 'circle' of the most experienced contributors (e.g., 2 people) and outer rings including less experienced contributors. We're calling this model the WISDOM Tree, by analogy to the growth rings that show the age of a tree. Each community who adopts this model could be visualised as a tree in a forest, with the trunk representing their core community and branches representing each project or sub-community. This analogy only goes so far, because in contrast to a physical tree, our model is infinitely filterable and can therefore be dynamically updated at the click of a button. But hey, that's why we love data at OHM. 

### Usage Examples
1. Gatherings. See [data and results](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HS7HFa9y6PfF61_wTuCAbj9RTHe94VLXulS0pDYgtns/edit?usp=sharing) from a [Open Heart + Mind (OHM)](https://github.com/openheartmind) gathering called Tiny OHM (see also [/reports](https://github.com/openheartmind/WISDOM/tree/main/reports)). We're also prototyping with [Vibe Camp](https://github.com/vibecamp) to review [contributions to Vibeclipse](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t1mzPUlnKUeTf_lUKJySg1yiL5AxLkMORp6L5ZHOTww/edit?usp=sharing).
2. Conferences. See our [working prototype](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kQJM2kEVulzwXBQZuvR46wxaQY5_ohm0rbndIkdEkSE/edit?usp=sharing) to evaluate contributions to the 2023 AIMOS open/meta-science conference.
4. Scholarly communication. Our model was originally designed to solve cultural inertia in the transition to open science platforms. If you work in the scholarly communication / evaluation space, we'd love to hear from you! 
5. Literally any contribution to _any_ community. We think of WISDOM as a _minimal universal model_, meaning that it is both flexible and adaptable to different community needs. We're collecting a list of organisations interested in exploring the framework, please add your name [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XF9CagLX1WUXaPy-HDYlY4kZv8HZngEGu7lM6EQnvy4/edit?usp=sharing) if interested so we can get in touch.

### About OHM
[Open Heart + Mind (OHM)](https://github.com/openheartmind) is a diverse community who have been prototyping the WISDOM framework since 2022 at our inclusive gift-based gatherings. We endeavour to make all of our documents, contributions, reviews and other materials publicly available under [open source licenses](https://doc.clickup.com/36615879/d/h/12xdp7-382/ed51fc76f354e55), but for the first two years chose to prototype in a third-party app called Clickup for reasons of usability and accessibility for our cOHMunity (contact if you'd like access). Github Projects has come a long way since then, however, and so we're now beginning the migration back to Github so we can be as open as we'd always intended to be. We're also developing an app (WisdOHM) that is our particular instantiation of the WISDOM framework and we're in the process of making open source. 

### About the Founder
Cooper Smout is a designer, data scientist and lifelong student of human behavior. During his PhD he became fascinated with the problem of incentivising open science practices and founded the [worlds first collective action platform for researchers](https://freeourknowledge.org/), aiming to overcome cultural inertia through conditional pledges. Drawing on insights from this work, he then designed a novel model for scholarly communication that aimed to incentivise participation by generating prestige through AI-powered open evaluation. Realising that this model was likely too radical for risk-averse academics, and inspired by the creativity of Burning man-style events, he left academia to prototype in the safer, more dynamic and inclusive environment of [gift-based gatherings](https://doc.clickup.com/36615879/d/h/12xdp7-722/0579897aba652af), where he has been dancing and collaborating with amazing humans since. 

### About the Name
WISDOM stands for Weighted Information Schema for Distributed Open science and Meta-research... or something like that (it's more the sentiment that counts). 




## Random bit
WISDOM (Weighted Information Schema for Distributed Open Merit) is a radically inclusive, empirical framework for autonomously measuring the relative value of community contributions, while incentivising engagement. 

It features a user-friendly, open peer-review protocol based on pairwise comparisons, where individuals can express their values by voting between pairs of contributions on multiple dimensions of interest. Individuals are immediately rewarded for the comparisons they complete, incentivising community members to engage with the system and provide valuable feedback, irrespective of their level of technological or project expertise.

The key innovation is in recognising pairwise comparisons as valuable contributions in their own right, and using them to scale the relative value of all other contributions. This is achieved through a novel meta-review process, where batches of reviews themselves are embedded in the comparison process and compared to regular contributions.  

Open source algorithms then convert these inputs into multidimensional  relative valuations of every contribution, on multiple dimensions reflecting community values. 

Crucially, throughout this entire process, no one person needs to do anything more complicated than a pairwise comparison, ensuring that the entire process remains accessible to the entire community. 




## WISDOM Properties
### Radically inclusive
WISDOM is designed from first principles to be maximally inclusive at both the individual and collective levels. At the individual level, community members peer-review each other's contributions via a simple, user-friendly review protocol based on pairwise comparisons. Critically, each of these comparisons is recognised as a valuable contribution in its own right and directly rewarded, providing a powerful incentive to engage with the system. At the collective level, communities can determine the dimensions on which their contributions are rated, aligning incentives and ensuring individual contributions are properly valued with respect to the collective vision and mission. Critically, these valuations are generated in standardised, interoperable units, meaning that aligned organizations who adopt this same framework can recognise each other’s contributions with respect to shared goals, and share resources in a decentralised and autonomous fashion.
