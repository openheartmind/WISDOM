## Edge City Demo Day
The Weighted Information Schema for Distributed Open Merit (WISDOM) is an open science framework that empowers communities to self-evaluate the quality of diverse contributions. It features a user-friendly, open peer-review protocol with direct rewards for feedback, thus incentivising engagement. The key innovation is the use of meta-reviews to quantify the relative value of reviews themselves, which are then used to generate relative valuations for all recorded contributions, given in standard units equivalent to the value of a single review. 

WISDOM is free and open source, can be adapted to a wide variety of use cases and values, and generates data that may be useful for autonomous reward and governance by communities at Edge City. In this presentation, I'll introduce the model, give a live demo of our spreadsheet prototype and proof-of-concept web app, then close with an invitation to ideate and collaborate.

WISDOM: Autonomous value recognition and reward for self-organising communities
In collaborative efforts, how do we ensure that every contribution is properly valued and every voice is heard? The Weighted Information Schema for Distributed Open Merit (WISDOM) is an open science framework for recognising the value of diverse contributions through open peer-review. It features an inclusive review protocol where every review is directly rewarded, incentivising engagement. Reviews are then weighted according to open source algorithms trained on meta-review data, resulting in a crowd-level representation of the unique qualities of every contribution. This rich dataset can then be filtered in a myriad of ways, generating automatic rewards for contributors and reputation metrics for merit-based governance.

## Cooper's homepage
WISDOM (Weighted Information Schema for Distributed Open Metrics) is an open review framework designed from first principles to revolutionise the way we recognise and reward contributions. It began life as a disruptive scholarly publishing model and evolved through active experimentation at Open Heart + Mind to become a generalizable framework for diverse, self-organizing communities. By creating a fair, transparent system for recognizing and rewarding all forms of contribution, WISDOM empowers contributors and connects diverse communities with aligned goals.

At the heart of WISDOM is an inclusive review protocol that earns reviewers immediate rewards for their reviews, which are converted into group-level estimates of the relative value of contributions. Contributors can then be directly rewarded for the value they provide, and respected for their proven expertise and reliability. The entire process is open, decentralized and autonomous, ensuring everyone can participate, while guarding against bias and cheating through a self-reflective meta-review process.

## AIMOS 2024
### Lightning Talk
#### WISDOM: An open science framework for community-driven value accounting
In this lightning talk, Iâ€™ll introduce WISDOM (Weighted Information Schema for Distributed Open Merit) and share data from our pilot at the AIMOS 2023 conference. Iâ€™ll begin with an overview of the model, showing how it can adapt to diverse use cases and facilitate the collective valuation of contributions according to community-selected values. Iâ€™ll highlight the key innovation: the use of pairwise comparisons as both an inclusive review protocol and a â€˜standard unit of contributionâ€™, which serve to peg the value(s) of all other contributions in a decentralised and autonomous manner. Iâ€™ll share data from our recent prototype, where we used WISDOM to recognise and reward contributions to the AIMOS 2023 conference. Iâ€™ll show how we empowered the AIMOS community to: (1) Record diverse contributions, including many that might otherwise go unnoticed; (2) Review contributions according to community-selected dimensions; (3) Recognise contributions for their diverse qualities; (4) Reward contributors for the value they provided; and, (5) Respect reviewers and contributors for their demonstrated expertise. Iâ€™ll present our major analyses and system upgrades, showing how this circular process of meta-research and iteration could produce a highly efficient, values-aligned research ecosystem. Iâ€™ll close with an invitation to nominate AIMOS 2024 contributions online and attend our follow-up hackathon, thus contributing to the latest iteration of the WISDOM experiment.

## Hackathon
#### Reviewing, recognising and rewarding diverse contributions to the AIMOS conference
The Weighted Information Schema for Distributed Open Merit (WISDOM) is an open science and meta-research framework for estimating the relative value of contributions to diverse communities. It features an inclusive review protocol and a decentralised, autonomous process to estimate contribution value, which can be used to recognise, reward and respect contributors for the value they create. 

In this hackathon, weâ€™ll use WISDOM to review and recognise diverse contributions to the AIMOS 2024 conference. Weâ€™ll begin with a demonstration of our prototype for AIMOS 2023, showing how contribution data were processed through each stage of the model (Record, Review, Recognise, Reward, and Respect) and sharing our major learnings from conducting this research. 

Next, weâ€™ll start work on the AIMOS 2024 prototype. Participants will be invited to nominate contributions and dimensions for rating via an online survey. Weâ€™ll edit the list of contributions and select a representative sample for review. Weâ€™ll discuss pros and cons of different rating dimensions, then choose a set of dimensions on which to rate AIMOS 2024 contributions. If our numbers permit, we may split into breakout groups to complete these tasks in parallel. 

Weâ€™ll also aim to complete some reviews during the hackathon itself, so please bring a laptop if you have one available. Weâ€™ll close the session with a round of reflections on the process, an overview of next steps, and an invitation to contribute further to the project. 

## README

Hi and welcome to the WISDOM system :)

We're developing a generalizable open scientific framework for recognising and rewarding contributions to the commons, so that we can empower contributors and connect diverse communities with aligned goals. 

### The Problem
Fair recognition and reward are central challenges in collaborative efforts, especially in commons-oriented fields like art, open source and academia. An ideal system should capture, recognise and reward the unique qualities of every contribution, fostering trust and incentivising engagement. 
Modern systems tend to be overly centralised, subjective, biased and/or unreliable, however, incentivising behaviours that reinforce the status quo rather than change it. More broadly, the use of incompatible systems limits the capacity for effective cooperation between organizations with aligned goals. 

### Our Solution
WISDOM is a flexible framework designed to crack the code of cultural change. By creating a standardised measure of gratitude for contributions, WISDOM aims to empower contributors and connect aligned communities in the pursuit of their common goals. 
At the heart of WISDOM is an inclusive review protocol that incentivises feedback about diverse contributions. This input is then converted into a multidimensional representation of the unique qualities of every recorded contribution. Contributors can then be rewarded with tokens representing the collective gratitude for their contibutions, which can be paid forward in thanks to other people in turn. Contributor expertise and reliability can also be expressed numerically, creating a platform for people who consistently deliver value to their community.
 
### Minimal Viable Model (MVM)
_0. Select Dimensions._ Communities can embed their values directly into the code by choosing the dimensions that contributions are rated on. WISDOM builds on previous [open evaluation models](https://doi.org/10.3389/fncom.2012.00079) that suggest a common 'primary dimension' can facilitate cross-comparison between communities. We propose "Gratitude" as the primary dimension because of its universal applicability and psychological benefits for communities of practice, but communities are free to choose any number of dimensions that reflect their values and particular use cases. 
_1. Record._ Contributions are recorded in a transparent register of the community's choice. The scale and scope of recorded contributions depends on the community, and members are incentivised to keep the register current, complete and accurate. 
_2. Review._ WISDOM uses pairwise comparisons to generate ratings at the crowd-level. Pairwise comparisons are a quick, simple and user-friendly review protocol, making them inclusive to diverse people irrespective of expertise or technical prowess. Anyone in the community can complete a pairwise comparison by voting between two contributions on each dimension of interest (e.g., "Which of these two contributions are you most grateful for?"). Reliable reviewers can also earn the status of '_meta-reviewer_', which entitles them to vote on the relative value of reviews themselves (termed a '_meta-review_'). 
_3. Recognise._ Pairwise comparisons are relatively uniform, meaning that we can treat them as a 'standard unit' of contribution and use them to scale all other contributions. We do this by including a range of review contributions (e.g., 32, 64, and 128 pairwise comparisons) in the meta-review stage and fitting a function to the resulting votes, then interpolating values for all non-review contributions (see _3. Recognise_ tab in our [pilot dataset](http://tiny.cc/tinyOHMresults)). The result is a numerical value representing the collective gratitude for every single contribution (see _Gratitude per contribution_ chart in our [pilot dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HS7HFa9y6PfF61_wTuCAbj9RTHe94VLXulS0pDYgtns/edit?usp=sharing)). Communities who include more than one review dimension can generate a multi-dimensional information matrix about each and every contribution (see _Contribution Qualities_ chart in our [pilot dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HS7HFa9y6PfF61_wTuCAbj9RTHe94VLXulS0pDYgtns/edit?usp=sharing)), which can be filtered to suit the needs of the user and their community.
_4. Reward._ Contributors can then be rewarded with tokens representing the collective gratitude for their contributions (see _OHMnoms per Contributor_ chart in our [pilot dataset](http://tiny.cc/tinyOHMresults)). Reviews are rewarded at the rate of 1 token per pairwise comparison (including all dimensions), and regular contributions are rewarded commensurate to the number of units on the Gratitude dimension (more complicated transfer functions could be explored in the future). Communities may agree to subtract common costs (e.g., the average cost of an event), leaving a balance that reflects each contributorâ€™s total energetic exchange with the community (see _OHMnom Balances_ chart in our [pilot dataset](http://tiny.cc/tinyOHMresults)). Excess tokens can be paid forward to other people who the contributor wishes to thank in turn, forming the basis of an evidence-based gifting economy.
_5. Respect._ By measuring contributions over time, we can generate metrics reflecting reviewer reliability and expertise within the community. Reviewer reliability can be measured using a range of measures (e.g., test-retest reliability, internal consistency), and trustworthy reviewers can be elevated to the status of _meta-reviewer_ (see _Reviewer Reliability_ chart in our [pilot dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HS7HFa9y6PfF61_wTuCAbj9RTHe94VLXulS0pDYgtns/edit?usp=sharing)). Experts in particular fields and topics can be identified by tracking the value they add to that field over time (e.g., see _Expertise: Science_ chart in our [pilot dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HS7HFa9y6PfF61_wTuCAbj9RTHe94VLXulS0pDYgtns/edit?usp=sharing)). Collectively, these metrics could form the basis of a merit-based participatory democracy algorithm, in which votes are weighted according to each person's validated expertise in the topic of interest. 

### Replicate and Repeat
All of the above processes should be conducted transparently and shared with the community, so that everyone can learn and grow together. The final stage is therefore to replicate the previous materials, embed any learnings, and repeat the process again. 

### Principles and Features
- _Transparent_. Contributions and reviews are shared publicly, so you know what's going on behind the scenes.
- _Inclusive_. Everyone is rewarded for their unique contributions, including reviews, meaning that everyone can contribute in the way that works for them.
- _Replicable_. Open source and forkable, so you can stand on the shoulders of giants.
- _Accessible_. Our review protocol is user-friendly and cognitively simple, so that anyone can contribute meaningful data no matter their circumstances.
- _Collaborative_. Our crowd-based reward mechanism incentivises collaboration over competition.
- _Diverse_. Our framework is flexible, scaleable and can be customised to the needs of different communities.
- _Honest_. Transparent reviews and reliability metrics encourage honesty and guard against cheats. 

### A Generalizable Framework
WISDOM is designed to be maximally inclusive to all communities. The MVM above is the simplest model possible for capturing quantitative meta-information -- information about the relative value of information. There are of course more nuanced ways to conduct reviews, but all of these can be considered derivatives of the MVM and could be valued accordingly (e.g., by valuing a lengthy written review in an equivalent number of pairwise comparisons). Communities are free to develop their own extensions to the core model, ideally sharing these developments publicly so that other communities can also adopt those extensions that make sense for them (and thanking each other accordingly). 
Each community can then decide which other communities to cooperate and trade tokens with, by assessing their transparent processes and data and deciding (if necessary) a relative weighting for the respective tokens. Providing that all communities adopt the MVM we present here, it would create a fundamental communication layer both within and between communities that directly encodes gratitude and facilitates cooperation toward common goals.
By integrating the three key functions of _communication_, _economics_ and _governance_, WISDOM aims to become a complete 'community operating system' for practically _any_ community.
 
#### Communication
WISDOM generates multidimensional, quantitative metadata (data about the relative qualities of data) that can be filtered in an infinite variety of ways and communicated globally. By embedding community values directly into the codebase, we can generate data that reflects those qualities and create a high-signal training ground for trustworthy AI. In contrast, the vast majority of current AI systems are trained on web-scraped data from the internet, which is niaively biased at best, and actively tuned toward suboptimal values at worst (e.g., profit, division, attention). 

#### Economics
In contrast to modern society, WISDOM places economics downstream from information gathering and communication. Communities are free to develop their own process and name for their token/s. At OHM, we call our gratitude tokens OHMnoms, in reference to the delicious little treats that our members contribute to the cOHMunity (or alternatively, as shorthand for the _nom_inations their contributions receive). OHMnoms are calculated by applying a function to the meta-information matrix. The current version of the algorithm is very simple -- a 1-to-1 mapping of the Gratitude dimension -- meaning that OHMnoms are a direct measure of the collective gratitude for contributions. In the future, this algorithm may be developed to include more variables, but for now we're just keeping it simple.
Other communities are free to develop their own calculation method and name for their own token. Each community could then decide what other communities to cooperate and trade with, e.g., by assessing their processes and data and determining a relative weighting for the respective tokens (if necessary). Providing that all communities adopt the MVM we present here, it would create a fundamental communication layer both within and between communities that directly encodes gratitude and facilitates cooperation toward common goals. 

#### Governance
WISDOM can also generate a governance framework where community members earn the right to have more say in how the community is governed. By tracking the relative value of contributions over time, we can build a representation of each person's expertise (or experience points) across different projects (e.g., hOHM Base), fields (e.g., music) or combinations thereof (e.g., music at hOHM Base). Core contributors might then have more influence over the direction of the project or community, for example by weighting votes in a collective voting process. This results in a process where everyone can have their say and be heard, but we listen more to those people who have been validated as experts within the community. 
Experience points could be visualised as concentric rings, with the inner-most ring representing a 'circle' of the most experienced contributors (e.g., 2 people) and outer rings including less experienced contributors. We're calling this model the WISDOM Tree, by analogy to the growth rings that show the age of a tree. Each community who adopts this model could be visualised as a tree in a forest, with the trunk representing their core community and branches representing each project or sub-community. This analogy only goes so far, because in contrast to a physical tree, our model is infinitely filterable and can therefore be dynamically updated at the click of a button. But hey, that's why we love data at OHM. 

### Usage Examples
1. Gatherings. See [data and results](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HS7HFa9y6PfF61_wTuCAbj9RTHe94VLXulS0pDYgtns/edit?usp=sharing) from a [Open Heart + Mind (OHM)](https://github.com/openheartmind) gathering called Tiny OHM (see also [/reports](https://github.com/openheartmind/WISDOM/tree/main/reports)). We're also prototyping with [Vibe Camp](https://github.com/vibecamp) to review [contributions to Vibeclipse](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t1mzPUlnKUeTf_lUKJySg1yiL5AxLkMORp6L5ZHOTww/edit?usp=sharing).
2. Conferences. See our [working prototype](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kQJM2kEVulzwXBQZuvR46wxaQY5_ohm0rbndIkdEkSE/edit?usp=sharing) to evaluate contributions to the 2023 AIMOS open/meta-science conference.
4. Scholarly communication. Our model was originally designed to solve cultural inertia in the transition to open science platforms. If you work in the scholarly communication / evaluation space, we'd love to hear from you! 
5. Literally any contribution to _any_ community. We think of WISDOM as a _minimal universal model_, meaning that it is both flexible and adaptable to different community needs. We're collecting a list of organisations interested in exploring the framework, please add your name [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XF9CagLX1WUXaPy-HDYlY4kZv8HZngEGu7lM6EQnvy4/edit?usp=sharing) if interested so we can get in touch.

### About OHM
[Open Heart + Mind (OHM)](https://github.com/openheartmind) is a diverse community who have been prototyping the WISDOM framework since 2022 at our inclusive gift-based gatherings. We endeavour to make all of our documents, contributions, reviews and other materials publicly available under [open source licenses](https://doc.clickup.com/36615879/d/h/12xdp7-382/ed51fc76f354e55), but for the first two years chose to prototype in a third-party app called Clickup for reasons of usability and accessibility for our cOHMunity (contact if you'd like access). Github Projects has come a long way since then, however, and so we're now beginning the migration back to Github so we can be as open as we'd always intended to be. We're also developing an app (WisdOHM) that is our particular instantiation of the WISDOM framework and we're in the process of making open source. 

### About the Founder
Cooper Smout is a designer, data scientist and lifelong student of human behavior. During his PhD he became fascinated with the problem of incentivising open science practices and founded the [worlds first collective action platform for researchers](https://freeourknowledge.org/), aiming to overcome cultural inertia through conditional pledges. Drawing on insights from this work, he then designed a novel model for scholarly communication that aimed to incentivise participation by generating prestige through AI-powered open evaluation. Realising that this model was likely too radical for risk-averse academics, and inspired by the creativity of Burning man-style events, he left academia to prototype in the safer, more dynamic and inclusive environment of [gift-based gatherings](https://doc.clickup.com/36615879/d/h/12xdp7-722/0579897aba652af), where he has been dancing and collaborating with amazing humans since. 

### About the Name
WISDOM stands for Weighted Information Schema for Distributed Open science and Meta-research... or something like that (it's more the sentiment that counts). 

## Random bit
WISDOM (Weighted Information Schema for Distributed Open Merit) is a radically inclusive, empirical framework for autonomously measuring the relative value of community contributions, while incentivising engagement. 

It features a user-friendly, open peer-review protocol based on pairwise comparisons, where individuals can express their values by voting between pairs of contributions on multiple dimensions of interest. Individuals are immediately rewarded for the comparisons they complete, incentivising community members to engage with the system and provide valuable feedback, irrespective of their level of technological or project expertise.

The key innovation is in recognising pairwise comparisons as valuable contributions in their own right, and using them to scale the relative value of all other contributions. This is achieved through a novel meta-review process, where batches of reviews themselves are embedded in the comparison process and compared to regular contributions.  

Open source algorithms then convert these inputs into multidimensional  relative valuations of every contribution, on multiple dimensions reflecting community values. 

Crucially, throughout this entire process, no one person needs to do anything more complicated than a pairwise comparison, ensuring that the entire process remains accessible to the entire community.

WISDOM: A Decentralized Framework for Community-Driven Value Recognition and Reward

#### Project Abstract (Max 300 words)
The Weighted Information Schema for Distributed Open Merit (WISDOM) is a radically inclusive, decentralized framework for autonomous recognition and reward of diverse contributions. WISDOM addresses fair value attribution in collaborative efforts, particularly in commons-oriented fields like open source, academia, and community projects.

At its core, WISDOM features a fast, simple review protocol based on pairwise comparisons, where reviewers choose between pairs of contributions on community-selected dimensions (e.g., gratitude). The key innovation lies in recognizing reviews as valuable contributions, rewarding them with a standard 'unit of valueâ€™, and using them to scale the relative value of all other contributions. This is achieved through meta-reviews, where reviews are embedded into the same review process and compared to regular contributions. Open source algorithms then convert these data into multidimensional scores for all contributions, with each unit representing the value of a single pairwise comparison. Critically, reviews are directly rewarded and never more complex than a simple pairwise comparison, incentivising feedback and maximizing the â€˜wisdom of the crowdâ€™ through diverse representation.

WISDOM encompasses six key processes: 
1. Record: Transparently documenting diverse contributions 
2. Review: Employing pairwise comparisons for inclusive evaluations and meta-evaluations 
3. Recognize: Generating multidimensional representations of contribution quality 
4. Reward: Distributing funds or tokens based on community-validated value 
5. Respect: Building reputation metrics for expertise and reviewer reliability 
6. Research: Conducting meta-research to iterate on the system

WISDOM has been prototyped at community arts gatherings and open science conferences, recognizing often-overlooked contributions and validating its inclusivity and adaptability to diverse populations. By standardizing contribution value across diverse fields and fostering a virtuous cycle of value creation, WISDOM aims to empower contributors, build trust, and connect communities through a dynamically-evolving, interconnected web of digitally-encoded values. 

#### What is the potential impact of your project on your field and society? (Max 200 words)
WISDOM has the potential to transform how value is recognized and rewarded across various fields and society at large. Its impact could be far-reaching:
Scientific Progress: By incentivizing open peer review and recognizing diverse contributions, WISDOM could accelerate scientific advancement and improve research quality.
Open Source Development: The framework could revolutionize how open source projects attribute value, potentially leading to more sustainable funding models for critical digital infrastructure.
Community Empowerment: By providing a transparent, inclusive system for recognizing contributions, WISDOM could strengthen community bonds and increase participation in collective efforts.
Meritocratic Governance: Reputation metrics generated by WISDOM could inform more equitable, expertise-based decision-making processes in autonomous organizations.
Economic Innovation: By creating a standardized "language" of contribution value, WISDOM could facilitate the development of new economic models based on gifting and actual value creation, rather than arbitrary metrics.
Cross-domain Collaboration: The framework's adaptability could foster unprecedented cooperation between diverse fields, connecting communities with aligned goals.
AI Training: By generating high-quality, values-aligned data, WISDOM could contribute to the development of more trustworthy and beneficial AI systems.
Social Equity: By recognizing and rewarding all forms of contribution, WISDOM could help address systemic biases in current value attribution systems, promoting a more inclusive society.

#### How could your project leverage blockchain, Web3, or decentralized infrastructures? (Max 200 words)
WISDOM is inherently aligned with decentralized principles and could leverage blockchain and Web3 technologies in several ways:
Immutable Record-Keeping: Blockchain can provide a transparent, tamper-proof ledger for recording contributions, reviews, and meta-reviews, ensuring data integrity.
Smart Contracts: Automated reward distribution based on WISDOM's algorithms could be implemented through smart contracts, ensuring fairness and reducing administrative overhead.
Tokenization: WISDOM's gratitude tokens (e.g., OHMnoms) could be implemented as blockchain-based tokens, facilitating seamless exchange within and between communities.
Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs): WISDOM's reputation metrics could inform governance structures in DAOs, enabling merit-based voting systems.
Interoperability: Web3 standards could allow different WISDOM implementations to communicate, enabling cross-community collaboration and value exchange.
Decentralized Storage: Technologies like IPFS could be used to store WISDOM data in a distributed manner, enhancing resilience and reducing centralization risks.
Self-Sovereign Identity: Web3 identity solutions could be integrated to manage user profiles and reputation across different WISDOM implementations.
Zero-Knowledge Proofs: These could be employed to verify contribution values or expertise levels without revealing sensitive information.
By leveraging these technologies, WISDOM can enhance its core principles of transparency, inclusivity, and decentralization, creating a robust, scalable system for recognizing and rewarding value across diverse communities.

# WISDOM Properties
### Radically inclusive
WISDOM is designed from first principles to be maximally inclusive at both the individual and collective levels. At the individual level, community members peer-review each other's contributions via a simple, user-friendly review protocol based on pairwise comparisons. Critically, each of these comparisons is recognised as a valuable contribution in its own right and directly rewarded, providing a powerful incentive to engage with the system. At the collective level, communities can determine the dimensions on which their contributions are rated, aligning incentives and ensuring individual contributions are properly valued with respect to the collective vision and mission. Critically, these valuations are generated in standardised, interoperable units, meaning that aligned organizations who adopt this same framework can recognise each otherâ€™s contributions with respect to shared goals, and share resources in a decentralised and autonomous fashion.
