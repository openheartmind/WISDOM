### Introduction
Thanks for your interest in this project! Please read the following information so that you can decide whether you would like to participate. Feel free to ask any questions you may have. 

Your participation in this project is voluntary. You do not have to participate if you do not wish to. If you decide to take part and later change your mind, you are free to stop at any time and do not need to explain your decision (see _What will happen if I decide to withdraw?_).

### What is this research about?
This research will use a novel open science framework ([WISDOM](https://github.com/openheartmind/WISDOM)) to quantify the relative value of diverse contributions to SIPS2024 (e.g., ideas,  actions, resources) and reward contributors with a representation of the community's gratitude. Reviewers will use a simple, user-friendly protocol that uses pairwise comparisons to vote between contributions on multiple dimensions of interest. These votes are then amalgamated to produce a crowd-level representation of community gratitude, which is awarded to contributors in recognition of their efforts. 

### Who is funding and organising this research?
This research project is currently unfunded and is organised by members of the Open Heart + Mind (OHM) and SIPS communities. The outputs of this research may be used to apply for funding and invite donations. 

### What will I need to do?
Complete a quick form to nominate your and other people's contributions for review and give us permission to review them publicly. You can also choose to be more involved in the study by signing up as a reviewer or collaborator. 

### What are the possible benefits of taking part?
Potential benefits to various stakeholders include:
- SIPS organisers, who may learn what contributions are most appreciated by the community
- the SIPS community, who may be recognised for their contributions and learn how to best serve the community
- metascientists and other researchers, who may benefit from prototyping a radically transparent information system
- funders, who may benefit from prototyping an automated funding mechanism
- other communities, who may adopt or fork the WISDOM framework
- the public, who may benefit from the development of a free, transparent, open source, replicable, dynamic, flexible and inclusive meta-communication system

Participants may also benefit personally by receiving 'token' rewards that represent the collective gratitude of the community. In the future these tokens may have further uses within the SIPS community (e.g., paying for conference fees) and other communities (e.g., attending [OHM Gatherings](https://app.clickup.com/36615879/v/dc/12xdp7-722)), depending on the level of adoption and support. 

### What are the possible risks and disadvantages of taking part?
Reviewers may find the questions we ask stressful, such as rating and comparing contributions on sensitive dimensions of interest. Reviewers may also be exposed to criticism of their publicly shared reviews. Participants may feel that the reviews or tokens awarded do not fairly reflect the level of effort or value added to the community. In these circumstances, we encourage participants and reviewers to treat these valuations as imperfect reflections of the true value and to share these concerns in the interests of developing a fairer system, together.

### What will happen to the information about me?
Data will be handled in accordance with the [OHM License agreement](https://doc.clickup.com/36615879/d/h/12xdp7-382/ed51fc76f354e55). All non-personal data and outputs (e.g., contributions, reviews, data analyses, reports) will be made openly available via CC-BY licences. The username you provide will be associated with your contributions upon public release. Any personal information you provide (e.g., real name, email) will remain confidential and only accessible to the project administrators. 

### What will happen if I decide to withdraw?
Your participation in this research is voluntary and you are free to withdraw from the research anytime without penalty or need for explanation. If you choose to stop participating prior to the public release of the research data, all the information collected from/about you will be destroyed and will not be used in the research. If you choose to stop participating after the public release of this dataset, we will anonymise and/or hide your data in any public releases that we have control over from that point forward.

### Can I hear about the results of this research?
The results of this research project will be shared publicly and/or presented in a variety of forms. Upon doing so we will inform participants via direct contact and the OHM and SIPS communities by relevant channels (e.g., Twitter, Discord, Facebook). 

### Who can I contact if I have any concerns about the project?
You are welcome to discuss your participation in this study with the [project lead](mailto:cooper.smout@gmail.com), their affiliated institution ([IGDORE](https://igdore.org/)), or a core member of OHM or SIPS.
