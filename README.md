# WISDOM

Hi and welcome to the WISDOM revolution :)

We're building an evidence-based framework to help communities self-organise and celebrate contributions, so that we can empower generous contributors and accelerate the transition to a gift-based economy that respects all forms of life on this planet. 

WISDOM is a radically transparent framework for self-organising communities, integrating three key functions of society:
1. Information: Multi-dimensional evaluation and recognition
2. Economics: Gratitude-based rewards within a gifting economy
3. Governance: Transparent ideation, voting and implementation

WISDOM stands for 
**W**eighted
**I**nformation 
**S**ystem for 
**D**istributed 
**O**nline 
**M**anagement.

WISDOM is being developed by the [Open Heart + Mind (OHM) Community](https://github.com/openheartmind), who are using [gift-based gatherings](https://github.com/openheartmind/OHM-Gathering/) as a safe space to prototype and refine the WISDOM framework.

### Principles
WISDOM is based on Open Science principles:
- _Transparency_. Contributions and reviews are shared publicly, so you know what's going on behind the scenes.
- _Replicability_. Open source and forkable, so you can stand on the shoulders of giants.
- _Accessibility_. Our review protocol is user-friendly and cognitively simple.
- _Collaborative_. Our reward mechanism incentivises collaboration over competition.
- _Diversity_. Our model is flexible, scaleable and can be customised to the needs of different communities. 
- _Inclusion_. Literally any community in the world could utilise our framework.

### Metascience
We are developing rigorous, evidence-based methods for determining the relative value of contributions, so that contributors can be given fair credit for their efforts. We aim to overcome bias and gaming through repeated experimentation and iteration as WISDOM evolves. Our initial forays into this new metaresearch paradigm are: 

1. A survey following the OHM Gathering pilot test (Coopapalooza), in which attendees were asked to allocate a pool of 'gratitude tokens' between the various contributions to the gathering (WisdOHM v0)
2. A prototype review protocol featuring numerical review on multiple dimensions (WisdOHM v1)
3. A survey prior to Tiny OHM, in which the crowd collectively selected their favourite headline acts (WisdOHM v2)
4. A survey after Tiny OHM, which produced our first complete dataset and proof of concept (WisdOHM v2.1)
5. A radically transparent application and review process that the OHM community used to collectively decide which offerings were scheduled for OHM Gathering.
6. A bespoke app ([WisdOHM](https://github.com/openheartmind/wisdohm)) that we are currently developing to review contributions to OHM and beyond.  

We're currently prototyping with diverse arts, scientific and indigenous communities. Please get in touch if your community would like to play with our working prototype!

### History
WISDOM was founded at the beginning of 2022 under the [OHM project](https://github.com/openheartmind). Our first two years of documentation and development were recorded in our transparent workspace in Clickup (contact for access). In March 2024 we began migrating to Github and Github Projects (work in progress; contact us for access to Clickup in the meantime).
