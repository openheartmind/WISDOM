# WISDOM

Hi and welcome to the WISDOM System :)

We are a community of developers and open scientists who are lovingly building a framework to help communities self-organise and celebrate contributions, so that we can empower generous contributors and accelerate the transition to a gift-based economy that respects all forms of life on this planet. 

WISDOM stands for 
**W**eighted
**I**nformation 
**S**ystem for 
**D**istributed 
**O**nline 
**M**anagement (or something like that... It's more the acronym that counts!)

WISDOM is a project of the [Open Heart + Mind (OHM) Community](https://github.com/openheartmind), where we're hosting [gift-based gatherings](https://github.com/openheartmind/OHM-Gathering/) and reviewing contributions as a safe space to explore and refine the WISDOM model.

WISDOM is based on Open Science principles:
- _Transparency_. Contributions and reviews are shared publicly, so you know what's going on behind the scenes.
- _Replicability_. Open source and forkable, so you can stand on the shoulders of giants.
- _Accessibility_. Our review protocol is user-friendly and cognitively simple.
- _Collaborative_. Our reward mechanism incentivises collaboration over competition.
- _Diverse_. Our model is flexible, scaleable and can be customised to the needs of different communities. 
- _Inclusive_. Literally any community in the world could utilise our framework.

We're currently developing an app and prototyping with diverse arts, scientific and indigenous communities. Please get in touch if your community would like to explore our working prototype! 

### Metascience
We are developing rigorous, evidence-based methods for determining the relative value of contributions, so that contributors can be given fair credit for their efforts. We aim to overcome bias and gaming through repeated experimentation and iteration as WISDOM evolves. Our initial forays into this new metaresearch paradigm are: 

1. A survey following the OHM Gathering pilot test (Coopapalooza), in which attendees were asked to allocate a pool of 'gratitude tokens' between the various contributions to the gathering (WisdOHM v0)
2. A prototype review protocol featuring numerical review on multiple dimensions (WisdOHM v1)
3. A survey prior to Tiny OHM, in which the crowd collectively selected their favourite headline acts (WisdOHM v2)
4. A survey after Tiny OHM, which produced our first complete dataset and proof of concept (WisdOHM v2.1)
5. A radically transparent application and review process that the OHM community used to collectively decide which offerings were scheduled for OHM Gathering.
6. A bespoke app ([WisdOHM](https://github.com/openheartmind/wisdohm)) that we are currently developing to review contributions to OHM and beyond.
