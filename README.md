# WISDOM

Hi and welcome to the WISDOM revolution :)

We're developing an open science framework for recognising and rewarding contributions to autonomous organisations, so that we can empower contributors, connect communities, and transition to a collaborative gift-based society. 

WISDOM stands for 
**W**eighted
**I**nformation 
**S**chema for 
**D**iverse / Distributed 
**O**rganisations and 
**M**etascience (or something like that... it's more the sentiment that counts).

### The challenge of cultural change
As our world grows increasingly interconnected, the need to learn from one another's experiences has never been greater. Yet, despite the wealth of knowledge all around us, most people remain resistant to actively sharing their insights and feedback. Entrenched cultural norms and technological inertia make it difficult to incentivize the behaviors needed to harness this collective wisdom.

### The WISDOM Solution
WISDOM is a flexible framework designed to crack the code of cultural change. By providing an adaptable model for understanding individual and collective motivations and directly rewarding engagement, WISDOM empowers diverse communities to foster knowledge-sharing and collective growth. 

At the heart of WISDOM is a simple, user-friendly review protocol that rewards individuals for their feedback about the relative quality of contributions. This input is then synthesized into a rich information matrix representing the crowd-valuation of every contribution across multiple dimensions of interest. Contributors are then rewarded with tokens reflecting the collective gratitude of the community, and awarded with badges reflecting their reliability and expertise within the community. 

WISDOM aims to become a complete operating system for any community, integrating the key functions of _information sharing_, [_economics_](https://github.com/openheartmind/WISDOM/tree/main/documents) and [_governance_](https://github.com/openheartmind/WISDOM/blob/main/documents/governance.md). By connecting diverse communities under a common framework, it creates a universal language for sharing gratitude and collaborating effectively toward common goals. 

### The Details
The first innovative feature of WISDOM is the use of pairwise comparisons to review contributions. Pairwise comparisons are cognitively simple, easy and quick, making them an inclusive paradigm for the everyday user. Moreover, pairwise comparisons are relatively standard, meaning that we can treat them as a base unit of contribution and reward them with a single token reflecting community gratitude. 

The second innovative feature of WISDOM is the use of meta-reviews to determine the relative value of all other contributions, relative to reviews. Pairwise comparisons are _themselves_ reviewed under the pairwise comparison paradigm, and the votes for review contributions are used to estimate a baseline and interpolate values for all other contributions. The result is a rich, multidimensional matrix representing the qualities of every single contribution, pegged to the base unit of gratitude for a single pairwise comparison. Contributors can then be rewarded with tokens representing these units of gratitude. By tracking value over time, we can also develop a rich profile for every user, creating an evidence-based mechanism for collective governance by established reputation. 

### Principles and Features
- _Transparent_. Contributions and reviews are shared publicly, so you know what's going on behind the scenes.
- _Inclusive_. Everyone is rewarded for their unique contributions, including reviewers under our [pairwise comparisons review protocol](https://github.com/openheartmind/WISDOM/blob/main/reports/v2-1_Tiny-OHM-post-review.md). 
- _Replicable_. Open source and forkable, so you can stand on the shoulders of giants.
- _Accessible_. Our review protocol is user-friendly and cognitively simple, so that anyone can contribute meaningful data no matter their circumstances.
- _Collaborative_. Our crowd-based reward mechanism incentivises collaboration over competition.
- _Diverse_. Our framework is flexible, scaleable and can be customised to the needs of different communities.
- _Honest_. Transparent reviews and reliability metrics encourage honesty and guard against cheats. 

### Usage Examples
1. Gatherings. See [data and results](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HS7HFa9y6PfF61_wTuCAbj9RTHe94VLXulS0pDYgtns/edit?usp=sharing) from a [Open Heart + Mind (OHM)](https://github.com/openheartmind) gathering called Tiny OHM (see also [/reports](https://github.com/openheartmind/WISDOM/tree/main/reports)). We're also prototyping with [Vibe Camp](https://github.com/vibecamp) to review [contributions to Vibeclipse](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t1mzPUlnKUeTf_lUKJySg1yiL5AxLkMORp6L5ZHOTww/edit?usp=sharing).
2. Conferences. See our [working prototype](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kQJM2kEVulzwXBQZuvR46wxaQY5_ohm0rbndIkdEkSE/edit?usp=sharing) to evaluate contributions to the 2023 AIMOS open/meta-science conference.
4. Scholarly communication. Our model was originally designed to solve cultural inertia in the transition to open science platforms. If you work in the scholarly communication / evaluation space, we'd love to hear from you! 
5. Literally any contribution to _any_ community. We think of WISDOM as a _minimal viable model_, meaning that it is both flexible and adaptable to different community needs. We're collecting a list of organisations interested in exploring the framework, please add your name [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XF9CagLX1WUXaPy-HDYlY4kZv8HZngEGu7lM6EQnvy4/edit?usp=sharing) if interested so we can get in touch.

### Development History
- 2019-2021: WISDOM designed as a solution for cultural inertia in academia
- Nov 2021: Hosted Heart + Mind Festival, used to prototype WISDOM v0 (token allocation)
- Jan 2022: [Open Heart + Mind (OHM)](https://github.com/openheartmind) founded to prototype the model in the safer context of gift-based gatherings
- Feb 2022: Applications to OHM Gathering open, used to prototype WISDOM v1 (structured rubric)
- Mar 2022: Pairwise comparison model proposed to community (WISDOM v2)
- May 2022: Development of WisdOHM app begins (note this app will be open sourced as soon as we can resolve some sensitive data issues in the codebase)
- June 2022: Hosted Tiny OHM, used to prototype WISDOM v2.0 / v2.1 and collect first complete dataset
- June 2023: Hosted OHM Gathering (data collection waiting on app)

Note that our first two years of documentation and development were recorded in our transparent Clickup workspace (contact Cooper Smout for access). In March 2024 we began migrating to Github and Github Projects (work in progress).

### Roadmap (work in progress)

### About the Founder
Cooper Smout is a designer, data scientist and lifelong student of human behavior. During his PhD (cognitive neuroscience) he became fascinated with the problem of incentivising open science practices and founded the [worlds first collective action platform for researchers](https://freeourknowledge.org/), aiming to overcome cultural inertia through conditional pledges. Drawing on insights from this work, he then designed a novel model for scholarly publishing with the necessary characteristics to incentivise engagement and compete with traditional journals on prestige. Realising that this model was likely too radical for risk-averse academics, and inspired by the creativity of Burning man-style events, he left academia to prototype in the safer, dynamic and inclusive environment of [gift-based gatherings](https://doc.clickup.com/36615879/d/h/12xdp7-722/0579897aba652af), where he has been dancing and collaborating with amazing humans since.
