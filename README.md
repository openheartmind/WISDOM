# WISDOM

Hi and welcome to the WISDOM System :)

**M**anagement (WISDOM)

We are a community of developers and open scientists who are lovingly building a framework to help communities self-organise and celebrate contributions, so that we can empower generous contributors and accelerate the transition to a gift-based economy that respects all forms of life on this planet. 

WISDOM is a project of the [Open Heart + Mind (OHM) Community](https://github.com/openheartmind), where we're hosting [gift-based gatherings](https://github.com/openheartmind/OHM-Gathering/) and reviewing contributions as a safe space to explore and refine the WISDOM model.

WISDOM is based on Open Science principles:
- _Transparency_. All contributions and reviews are listed publicly, so you know what's going on.
- _Replicability_. Open source and forkable, so you can stand on the shoulders of giants.
- _Accessible_. Our review protocol is user-friendly and cognitively simple.
- _Collaborative_. Our reward mechanism incentivises collaboration over competition.
- _Diverse_. Our model is flexible, scaleable and can be customised to each communities needs. 
- _Inclusive_. Literally any community in the world could utilise the framework.

We're currently developing an app and prototyping with arts, scientific and indigenous communities. Please get in touch if your community would like to collaborate! 

### Metascience
We are actively developing processes for determining the relative value of different contributions, so that contributors can be fairly recognised for their efforts. We aim to overcome bias and gaming through repeated experimentation and iteration in line with what we learn about WISDOM itself. Our initial forays into this new metaresearch paradigm are: 

1. A survey following the OHM Gathering pilot test (Coopapalooza), in which attendees were asked to allocate a pool of 'gratitude tokens' between the various contributions to the gathering (WisdOHM v0)
2. A prototype review protocol featuring numerical review on multiple dimensions (WisdOHM v1)
3. A survey prior to Tiny OHM, in which the crowd collectively selected their favourite headline acts (WisdOHM v2)
4. A survey after Tiny OHM, which produced our first complete dataset and proof of concept (WisdOHM v2.1)
5. A radically transparent application and review process that the OHM community used to collectively decide which offerings were scheduled for OHM Gathering.
6. A bespoke app (WisdOHM) that we are actively developing to review contributions to OHM and beyond.
