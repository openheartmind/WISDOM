# WISDOM

Hi and welcome to the WISDOM revolution :)

We're developing an open science framework for recognising and rewarding contributions to autonomous organisations, so that we can empower contributors, connect communities, and transition to a collaborative gift-based society. 

WISDOM stands for 
**W**eighted
**I**nformation 
**S**chema for 
**D**iverse / Distributed 
**O**rganisations and 
**M**etascience (or something like that... it's more the sentiment that counts).

### The challenge of cultural change
As our world grows increasingly interconnected, the need to learn from one another's experiences has never been greater. Yet, despite the wealth of knowledge all around us, most people remain resistant to actively sharing their insights and feedback. Entrenched cultural norms and technological inertia make it difficult to incentivize the behaviors needed to harness this collective wisdom.

### The WISDOM Solution
WISDOM is a flexible framework designed to crack the code of cultural change. By providing an adaptable model for understanding individual and collective motivations and directly rewarding engagement, WISDOM empowers diverse communities to foster knowledge-sharing and collective growth. 

At the heart of WISDOM is a simple, user-friendly review protocol that rewards individuals for their feedback about the relative quality of contributions. This input is then synthesized into a rich information matrix representing the crowd-valuation of every contribution across multiple dimensions of interest. Contributors are then rewarded with tokens reflecting the collective gratitude of the community, and awarded with badges reflecting their reliability and expertise within the community. 

WISDOM aims to become a complete operating system for any community, integrating the key functions of _information sharing_, [_economics_](https://github.com/openheartmind/WISDOM/tree/main/documents) and [_governance_](https://github.com/openheartmind/WISDOM/blob/main/documents/governance.md). By connecting diverse communities under a common framework, it creates a universal language for sharing gratitude and collaborating effectively toward common goals. 

### Principles and features
- _Transparent_. Contributions and reviews are shared publicly, so you know what's going on behind the scenes.
- _Inclusive_. Everyone is rewarded for their unique contributions, including reviewers under our [pairwise comparisons review protocol](https://github.com/openheartmind/WISDOM/blob/main/reports/v2-1_Tiny-OHM-post-review.md). 
- _Replicable_. Open source and forkable, so you can stand on the shoulders of giants.
- _Accessible_. Our review protocol is user-friendly and cognitively simple, so that anyone can contribute meaningful data no matter their circumstances.
- _Collaborative_. Our crowd-based reward mechanism incentivises collaboration over competition.
- _Diverse_. Our framework is flexible, scaleable and can be customised to the needs of different communities.
- _Honest_. Transparent reviews and reliability metrics encourage honesty and guard against cheats. 

### Usage Examples
1. Festivals and gatherings. See [data and results of our proof-of-concept dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HS7HFa9y6PfF61_wTuCAbj9RTHe94VLXulS0pDYgtns/edit?usp=sharing), collected at an [Open Heart + Mind (OHM)](https://github.com/openheartmind) gathering called Tiny OHM (see also [/reports](https://github.com/openheartmind/WISDOM/tree/main/reports))
2. Conferences. See our [working prototype](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kQJM2kEVulzwXBQZuvR46wxaQY5_ohm0rbndIkdEkSE/edit?usp=sharing) to evaluate contributions to the 2023 meeting of the Association for Interdisciplinary Meta-Research and Open Science (AIMOS).
4. Scholarly communication. Our model was originally designed to overcome cultural inertia in the transition to open science platforms. 
5. Literally any contribution to _any_ community. Our framework is both simple and flexible, meaning it can most likely be used within communities you're already a part of. See [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XF9CagLX1WUXaPy-HDYlY4kZv8HZngEGu7lM6EQnvy4/edit?usp=sharing) for a list of partner organisations exploring WISDOM, or to add your name to the list (we'll be in touch).

### Development History
WISDOM was originally designed as a solution for cultural inertia in academia. [Open Heart + Mind (OHM) Community](https://github.com/openheartmind) was founded in 2022 to prototype the model in the safer context of gift-based gatherings. OHM has hosted [several gatherings](https://github.com/openheartmind/WISDOM/tree/main/reports) and prototyped different review protocols before settling on the pairwise comparison version we call WISDOM. OHM is also developing a bespoke app called ([WisdOHM](https://github.com/openheartmind/wisdohm)) that will be open sourced as soon as we resolve some sensitive data issues in the codebase. Note that our first two years of documentation and development were recorded in our transparent Clickup workspace (contact Cooper Smout for access). In March 2024 we began migrating to Github and Github Projects (work in progress).

### About the Founder
Cooper Smout is a designer, data scientist and lifelong student of human behavior. During his PhD (cognitive neuroscience) he became fascinated with the problem of incentivising open science practices and founded the [worlds first collective action platform for researchers](https://freeourknowledge.org/), aiming to overcome cultural inertia through conditional pledges. Drawing on insights from this work, he designed a novel model for scholarly publishing with the potential to generate prestige and compete with traditional journals. Realising that this model was likely too radical for risk-averse academics, and inspired by the creativity of Burning man-style events, he left academia to prototype in the safer (and more inclusive) environment of [gift-based gatherings](https://doc.clickup.com/36615879/d/h/12xdp7-722/0579897aba652af), where he has been collaborating with amazing humans since.
