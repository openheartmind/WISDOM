### Introduction
Thanks for your interest in this project! Please read the following information so that you can decide whether you would like to participate. Feel free to ask any questions you may have. 

Your participation in this project is voluntary. You do not have to participate if you do not wish to. If you decide to take part and later change your mind, you are free to stop at any time and do not need to explain your decision (see _What will happen if I decide to withdraw?_).

What is this research about?
This research will use a novel review protocol and metascientific system (WisdOHM) to quantify the relative value of diverse contributions to AIMOS23 (e.g., ideas, actions, resources) and reward contributors with a representation of the community's gratitude. Reviewers will use a simple, user-friendly protocol that leverages pairwise comparisons to vote between contributions on multiple dimensions of interest. These votes are then amalgamated to produce a crowd-level representation of community gratitude, which is awarded to contributors in recognition of their efforts. For more details on the model, including pilot data and findings, please see this recording from AIMOS23. 

Who is funding and organising this research?
This research project is currently unfunded and is being organised by members of the Open Heart + Mind (OHM) and AIMOS communities. The outputs of this research may be used to apply for funding opportunities and invite donations to the project. 

What will I need to do?
The minimum level of participation is completing a quick form that gives us permission to review your AIMOS23 contributions and display them publicly alongside reviewer-generated metrics. You can also use the form to nominate additional contributions for review and/or express interest in joining the project as a reviewer or collaborator. 

What are the possible benefits of taking part?
Potential benefits to various stakeholders include:
AIMOS organisers, who could learn what contributions are most appreciated by the community
the AIMOS community, who could receive recognition and reward for their contributions and learn how to best serve their peers
metascientists and other researchers, who may benefit from the prototype of a radically transparent and autonomous research system
funders, who may benefit from the prototype of an efficient and accountable funding mechanism
the OHM community, who may benefit from the metascientific analyses and other learnings of this project
other communities, who may wish to adopt the same system to their own circumstances
the public, who may benefit from the provision of a free, transparent, open source, replicable, dynamic, flexible and inclusive communication and evaluation system

Participants may also benefit personally, by receiving direct rewards for their contributions in the form of numerical 'tokens' that reflect the collective gratitude of the community. In the future these 'tokens' could have further uses within AIMOS (e.g., paying for conference fees) and other communities (e.g., attending OHM Gatherings), depending on the level of adoption and support. 

What are the possible risks and disadvantages of taking part?
Reviewers may find the questions we ask stressful, such as rating and comparing contributions on sensitive dimensions of interest. Reviewers may also be exposed to criticism of their publicly shared reviews. Participants may feel that the reviews or tokens awarded do not fairly reflect the level of effort or value added to the community. In these circumstances, we encourage participants and reviewers to treat these valuations as imperfect reflections of the true value of contributions, and to share any concerns they may have in the interests of developing a fairer system, together.

What will happen to the information about me?
Data will be handled in accordance with the License agreement at OHM. All non-personal data and outputs (e.g., contributions, reviews, data analyses, reports) will be made openly available via CC-BY licences. The username you provide will be associated with your contributions upon public release. Any personal information you provide (e.g., real name, email) will remain confidential and only accessible to the project administrators. 

What will happen if I decide to withdraw?
Your participation in this research is voluntary and you are free to withdraw from the research anytime without penalty or need for any explanation. If you choose to stop participating prior to the public release of the research data and findings (estimated for January 2024), all the information collected from/about you will be destroyed and will not be used in the research. If you choose to stop participating after the public release of this dataset, we will anonymise and/or hide your data in any public releases that we have control over from that point forward.

Can I hear about the results of this research?
We anticipate that the results of this research project will be published and/or presented in a variety of forms. Upon doing so we will inform participants and the AIMOS community by direct contact and relevant channels (e.g., Slack), respectively. 

Who can I contact if I have any concerns about the project?
You are welcome to discuss your participation in this study with the project lead, their affiliated institution (IGDORE), or a core member of OHM.
