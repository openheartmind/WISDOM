# Tiny OHM 1
Tiny OHM #1 was our first official gathering since the charity merger and served as an opportunity to test the new open review model. It was a huge success, attended and co-created by over 100 community members. Thanks for all the magic, dear cOHMmunity!

### When, where and who
25th June 2022 from 10am-10pm in Orleigh Park, Brisbane. We co-created Tiny OHM in collaboration with 22 organizers and 21 performers, presenters & facilitators from our cOHMunity. 

### Crowdsourced headline acts
Prior to the event we invited the cOHMunity to apply as 'headliners' for the gathering, resulting in 21 offerings. We then invited the cOHMunity to [publicly review](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pQZDUxfWp-bcdKmXRrk9xqruLK9EkOj3TJ03FbdaIDM/edit?usp=sharing) those offerings with our latest [open review prototype](https://github.com/openheartmind/WISDOM/blob/main/reports/WISDOM_v2.md), resulting in a [ranked list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UBonYNYcRWKW1PDkZH619Lo8JXC3QqYqPpKx5MDpAyI/edit?usp=sharing) of the offerings across multiple dimensions. We were happy to see that the crowd favoured diversity, with the top 5 offerings spanning our major categories of art, music, science and wellbeing. These headliners were awarded priority timeslots, marketing support and a monetary bonus of $100/hour, made possible by a donation to our charity. Happily, we could also squeeze in all the non-headliner acts across our two stages, so no one needed to miss out! 

### Diverse offerings
In addition to the diverse art, music, wellbeing & science offerings, we also welcomed several spontaneous offerings that arose on the day. We planned and served a delicious lunch, coming together in circle to give thanks and connect as a community. Chai tea was served throughout the afternoon and we collected $280 in donations on the day.

### Recording contributions
We tracked as many [goods](https://sharing.clickup.com/36615879/l/h/6-186768116-1/a17adeecbd7f869) and [services](https://sharing.clickup.com/36615879/l/h/6-180893388-1/eb08a0b5910c2d6) as we could in our transparent workspace, so that they can be reviewed under WISDOM at a later date. The photos below capture just a sliver of the goodness we created, thanks to one and all!

### Reviewing contributions
Stay tuned for our next implementation of WISDOM, where we plan to collectively review these contributions and reward contributors with OHM Noms, our concept gratitude token.
