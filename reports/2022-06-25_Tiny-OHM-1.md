# Tiny OHM #1
Tiny OHM #1 was our first official gathering since the charity merger and served as an opportunity to test our new WISDOM v2 review model. It was a huge success and adored by many. Thanks for all the magic, dear cOHMmunity!

### When, where and who
Tiny OHM was held on 25th June 2022 from 10am-10pm in Orleigh Park, Brisbane. It was a public event co-created by 22 organizers and 21 performers, presenters & facilitators, and attended by well over 100 people throughout the day and night.

### Crowdsourced offerings
Prior to the event 21 people applied to be 'headliners' for the gathering. Our cOHMunity [publicly reviewed](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pQZDUxfWp-bcdKmXRrk9xqruLK9EkOj3TJ03FbdaIDM/edit?usp=sharing) those offerings with our latest [open review prototype](https://github.com/openheartmind/WISDOM/blob/main/reports/WISDOM_v2.md), resulting in a [ranked list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UBonYNYcRWKW1PDkZH619Lo8JXC3QqYqPpKx5MDpAyI/edit?usp=sharing) of the offerings across multiple dimensions. We were happy to see that the crowd favoured diversity, with the top 5 offerings spanning our major categories of art, music, science and wellbeing. Those headliners were awarded priority timeslots, marketing support and a monetary bonus of $100/hour, made possible by a donation to our charity. Happily, we could also squeeze in all the non-headliner acts across our two stages, so no one needed to miss out! 

### Diverse offerings
In addition to the scheduled art, music, wellbeing & science offerings, we also received several spontaneous offerings on the day. We planned and served a delicious lunch, coming together in circle to connect and give thanks as a community. Chai tea was served throughout the afternoon and we collected $280 in donations on the day.

### Recording contributions
We tracked as many [goods](https://sharing.clickup.com/36615879/l/h/6-186768116-1/a17adeecbd7f869) and [services](https://sharing.clickup.com/36615879/l/h/6-180893388-1/eb08a0b5910c2d6) as we could in our transparent workspace, so that they can be reviewed and recognized properly at a later date. The photos below capture just a sliver of the goodness we created, thanks to one and all!

### Next steps
Stay tuned for our follow-up survey to review contributions to the event, so that we can recognize and reward contributors under the WISDOM system.
