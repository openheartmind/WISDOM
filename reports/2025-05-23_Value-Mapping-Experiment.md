# Value Mapping: A Participatory Experiment to Map OHM's Collective Values
## by OHM Seed Council

### 1. Abstract
This study explores collective value selection for governance documents through a four-stage participatory experiment by the Open Heart Mind (OHM) community. Over four weeks, we used the Metavaluation framework to address how decentralised communities can authentically determine shared values for operational governance.

Participants nominated diverse values and completed pairwise comparisons using the WisdOHM prototype, earning direct rewards for their reviews in OHMnoms: tokens representing value toward the OHM mission. Two subgroups completed separate prototypes, revealing different value priorities while identifying common themes around integrity, consent, and regeneration.

Ten prioritised values were embedded into the OHM Covenant, demonstrating a principled method for iterative development of governance documents that reflect the evolving values of maturing communities. Key findings include the system's ability to capture distinct subgroup perspectives, incentivise engagement through participant rewards, and support progressive decentralisation in DAOs.

### 2. Introduction
Community formation begins with value alignment, but understanding how values relate to an organization's broader strategic framework requires examining the interconnected hierarchy of purpose, vision, mission, and values.

Organizational theory establishes that purpose defines why an organization exists, vision describes where it's going, mission outlines what it will do to get there, and values guide how people behave along the way. Organizations are more effective when these elements align and target effort in the same direction.

For DAOs, this framework presents unique challenges. Research shows that organizations with clearly communicated, widely shared mission and vision perform better, but only when strategy and goals align with them. This creates tension for DAOs pursuing progressive decentralization: maintaining strategic coherence while allowing governance documents to evolve with community input.

In the OHM Covenant, we positioned values as subservient to our purpose, vision, and mission. This hierarchy makes the Values section a relatively low-risk starting point for exploring community-driven governance, without jeopardizing our overall strategic direction.

#### 2.1 The challenge of values in governance
Values are often embedded into governance documents with the intention of guiding community behavior and processes. But this raises fundamental questions: Who chooses these values? Do they truly represent the project and community? And critically, do they actually guide behavior?

When governance statements are not supported by actual practice, people have no real guidance, which can lead organizations toward disaster. In many cases, values may be chosen by a small group or even one person and enshrined without broader discussion. While this isn't inherently problematic for new organizations, it risks failing to capture the authentic values of the community as it grows and evolves.

OHM exemplifies this challenge: our founding documents were largely written by one person, reflecting a particular vision for achieving our stated purpose. This approach contradicts our very mission—to develop a truly decentralized autonomous organization where collective will, not individual authority, drives evolution.

#### 2.2 From Values to Evaluation
This tension between foundational stability and community authenticity becomes particularly acute when values must serve operational purposes. Under our Metavaluation framework and WisdOHM system, values aren't merely aspirational—they become the dimensions used to evaluate and reward contributions.

Previous WisdOHM prototypes have explored various approaches to selecting these evaluation dimensions, from top-down selection to crowd-based surveys. Our most sophisticated attempt at AIMOS used participant nominations followed by popularity-based selection. However, such methods introduce bias and may not reflect what the community actually values most for achieving its mission.

#### 2.3 Progressive decentralisation
At OHM, we're taking a 'progressive decentralization' approach. While processes begin relatively centralized among trusted individuals, we continuously explore ways to decentralize decision-making _without putting the whole enterprise at risk_. System health comes first; specific values like decentralization follow when they can be adopted safely.

#### 2.4 Aims
This experiment addresses both theoretical and practical challenges. **Theoretically**, we're exploring whether a community can collectively define values for governance documents in a way that's both authentic and operationally useful. **Practically**, we're developing a principled method for selecting evaluation dimensions in WisdOHM—moving beyond popularity-based approaches toward genuine collective intelligence.

The Values section of our Covenant provides an ideal testing ground: positioned after purpose, vision, and mission, it allows us to experiment with community-driven governance without risking our overall strategic direction. If successful, this could establish a model for dynamic, evolving governance documents that genuinely represent community values as they develop over time.

#### 2.5 A Year-long Experiment in Participatory Governance
This value mapping experiment represents the first step in a year-long series of monthly experiments exploring new use cases for Metavaluation in community governance. Each month will address common governance challenges, building toward the release of the WisdOHM MVP and culminating in a decentralized gathering in Southeast Queensland, Australia ("OHM Gathering").

The year-long arc serves multiple purposes: it allows us to iteratively test and refine the WisdOHM system across diverse governance scenarios, build community engagement and expertise with the platform, and create a comprehensive case study of progressive decentralization in practice. The finale—collectively valuing all year-long contributions with potential rewards for key contributors—will demonstrate the full Metavaluation framework at scale.

For these initial months, we're using the WisdOHM spreadsheet prototype as our primary tool, with learnings feeding directly into the development of the WisdOHM platform.

### 3. Experimental Stages and Findings

#### 3.0 Experiment Design Overview
The experiment was implemented across four stages over four weeks in May 2025, each anchored by an online community meeting with asynchronous participation opportunities (see meeting agendas and notes [here]([https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VEhDQgvBna5tmroU58wR08090EtHjkYXxZt7yo1kEeQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.ha3bvfajdt0l](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VEhDQgvBna5tmroU58wR08090EtHjkYXxZt7yo1kEeQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.ha3bvfajdt0l))). The design followed a participatory research approach, where community members were both subjects and co-researchers in defining collective values. 

Each of the following four sections describes a single stage in terms of its objective, meeting details, materials used, methods employed, results obtained, and key learnings.

#### 3.1 Activation and Intention-setting

##### Objective
The first stage served to reactivate the OHM community after a year-long hiatus, outline plans for the coming year, and launch a participatory "value mapping" experiment to prioritise values for the year ahead. As the first open cOHMunity call since early 2024, this session aimed to re-engage the existing community while connecting with new collaborators from around the world.

##### Meeting:

- Name: ["OHM Council 1: Seed"]([https://youtu.be/t31ejey_D28](https://youtu.be/t31ejey_D28))

- When: Mon 28 April 2025

- Where: Zoom, with invitations distributed via Substack, Telegram, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Luma

- Who: 37 participants, including long-term contributors, new community members, and interested collaborators.

##### Materials:
- Presentation slides from invited projects spanning the Permaculture (High Valley Dawn), Burning Man (Modifyre), and Open Science (Metascience Alliance) movements.
- ["Coming OHM Story" slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ExNHv3RK74fxpbMrL-7ukX6QYo5_CxzfYM1ktx8bJ2g/edit?usp=sharing) introducing OHM, the WisdOHM system, and OHM’s year-long governance experiment

##### Method: 
- The session followed a structured 60-minute [agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VEhDQgvBna5tmroU58wR08090EtHjkYXxZt7yo1kEeQ/edit?usp=sharing) designed to balance community building with information sharing. Key components included participant introductions (15 mins), community spotlights from three aligned movements (20 mins), and the "Coming OHM Story" presentation with the year-long experimental programme (20 mins). The session positioned value mapping as the first foundational step and invited attendees to participate in the nomination process scheduled for the following week.

##### Results:
- 37 participants attended from 6 countries across 4 continents (e.g., Australia, India, UK, Bhutan, Thailand, Germany), representing a range of cultures, age brackets, demographics, and professional backgrounds including science, technology, arts, and community organising.
  
##### Reflections:
- 60 minutes was not long enough to fit all the content -- future sessions should allocate 90 minutes or reduce content.
- The diverse audience validated the inclusive nature of the WisdOHM system and its wide range of potential use cases across communities and contexts. 
- The strong attendance (37 participants) exceeded expectations and validated interest in the OHM project, setting a positive foundation for subsequent experimental stages.

#### 3.2 Value Nomination

  
##### Objective
The second stage aimed to collate a list of values that the community considered important to reaching the OHM mission. 
  

##### Meeting:

- Name: "Seed Council A: Planting Values"

- When: 5 May 2025

- Where: Zoom, with invitations distributed via Substack, Telegram, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Luma

- Who: 14 participants
  

##### Materials:

- [Google Form](https://forms.gle/nvmJ7hTyHncSeLJ77) with fields for participant details, title (single word) and description (1–2 sentences explaining its relevance) of a value relevant to the OHM mission.


##### Method:

Participants were invited to nominate values via the form both during the meeting and asynchronously. 13 participants submitted a total of 30 value nominations.


##### Analysis:

Value nominations were [reviewed and processed](https://github.com/openheartmind/cOHMunity/issues/240) in ChatGPT, including:
- Standardising title formatting
- Merging duplicates
- Rewriting descriptions into a consistent two-sentence structure: 
	- (What the value means in general.) 
	- (Why or how it matters within OHM / how it might be practiced or activated by the community.)

For example, the following two descriptions for "Regeneration":

*"We design for long-term flourishing — restoring ecosystems, cultures, and systems of care.*
*We build in ways that allow future communities to reproduce, reuse, and evolve what we leave behind."*

*"Self-sustaining systems - ecological and beyond. Prioritises restoring, renewing, and enhancing systems and usually requires stewardship"*

... were merged into the following:

*"Regeneration is the design of systems that restore, renew, and support long-term flourishing. At OHM, it shapes how we care for ecosystems and build structures that future communities can evolve and reuse."*


##### Results: 

- 30 nominations yielded significant overlap, with Integrity nominated three times and Regeneration, Care, and Curiosity each nominated twice, suggesting natural convergence around core values.
- Nominations clustered around five themes: relational dynamics, learning/creativity, ethical behaviour, systems thinking, and inclusivity.
- Data processing yielded [25 unique values described in consistent format](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1On7U2SSBFABL_W0OEx1jFZo2ApjVSevqXZhHuuLMQ3w/edit?gid=1931237159#gid=1931237159), ready for voting by the community.

##### Reflections:
- The diversity of nominations reflected the interdisciplinary nature of participants, ranging from interpersonal values (Consent, Care) to systems-level concepts (Cosmolocalism, Decentralization)
- Future iterations could benefit from clearer prompts in the nomination form, such as example values and two-sentence descriptions.
- Data processing methods could also be strengthened by incorporating community feedback to ensure processed descriptions match original intent.


#### 3.3 Value Evaluation

##### Meeting:

- Name: "Seed Council B: Tending Values"

- When: 12 May 2025

- Who: 13 participants


##### Materials:

Three prototypes were created by duplicating the latest version of the WisdOHM prototype:

- [OHM Value prototype: cOHMunity Live](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1On7U2SSBFABL_W0OEx1jFZo2ApjVSevqXZhHuuLMQ3w/edit?usp=sharing), completed during live session 

- [OHM Value prototype: OHMcore]([https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y35eUJSpsYku72Vqv_4xzMd3Fuo2WJ4qRPS-LbKznPg/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y35eUJSpsYku72Vqv_4xzMd3Fuo2WJ4qRPS-LbKznPg/edit?usp=sharing)), completed asynchronously 

- [OHM Value prototype: cOHMunity Asynchronous]([https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IfU9k4zBjlqtSdYueXkzMxYKc-hYB0yFhTrM23DqfsA/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IfU9k4zBjlqtSdYueXkzMxYKc-hYB0yFhTrM23DqfsA/edit?usp=sharing)), open and incomplete

Each prototype included the list of 25 values presented as randomised pairwise comparisons, for a total of 600 comparisons per prototype.

  

##### Method:

Participants were asked to choose a username and indicate their agreement with the OHM Covenant and WisdOHM Terms & Conditions. They were then invited to complete as many pairwise comparisons as they wished, using a dropdown selection (Value A or B) to indicate which value they believed better reflected OHM’s mission. Each vote earned the reviewer 1 "OHMnom" as a measure of value to the OHM mission. Reviewers could leave qualitative comments for specific comparisons (optional). Nine participants completed the cOHMunity (Live) prototype during the meeting (600 comparisons). Two participants completed the OHMcore prototype asynchronously after the session (600 comparisons). The cOHMunity (Asynchronous) prototype remains incomplete and open for completion by the cOHMunity. Reviewers were also invited to provide an ETH-compatible wallet address for potential rewards in the future. 

  

##### Analysis:

Votes for each value were tallied across all comparisons and used to rank order values within each prototype. 

  

##### Results: 

- 9 reviewers and 2 reviewers completed a total of 600 comparisons for each of the cOHMunity and OHMcore prototypes, respectively.
- The cOHMunity and OHMcore prototypes yielded different rank-orders. In order, the top 10 rankings were: 
	- OHMcore: Care, Consent, Integrity, Decentralization, Respect, Regeneration, Custodianship, Transparency, Gifting, Plurality
	- cOHMunity: Regeneration, Integrity, Community, Creativity, Generosity, Respect, Consent, Transparency, Playfulness, Consciousness
- Three values (Regeneration, Integrity, and Consent) appeared in both top 10s
- Care ranked #1 in OHMcore but was absent from cOHMunity's top 10. Conversely, Community was third-rated by the cOHMunity but absent from the OHMcore top-10.


  
##### Reflections:

- Different approaches to the task became apparent, with some people completing many comparisons quickly and other people taking a more considered approach. Some participants also added notes to their comparisons, indicating a desire to explain their reasoning process.
- Participants are more likely to complete comparisons live than asynchronously. 
- WisdOHM successfully captured distinct value sets from different user groups. Meanwhile, similarities across prototypes indicated some values resonate throughout the entire community.
- Only two reviewers provided ETH-compatible wallet addresses, suggesting our community is not very crypto-literate, or that they didn't see the value in doing so.


#### 3.4 Value Mapping

  

##### Meeting

- Name: "Seed Council C: Mapping Values"

- When: 19 May 2025

- Who: 10 participants

  

##### Materials:

- [OHM Value Meta-results spreadsheet]([https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gexUeegeufmG_pHzOuX3kelKZAQqvSzQdhTw2xaOrdo/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gexUeegeufmG_pHzOuX3kelKZAQqvSzQdhTw2xaOrdo/edit?usp=sharing)), including ranked value lists for each prototype, total votes across both prototypes, combined rank-order, and OHMnom leaderboard

  

##### Method:

- Participants reflected on the voting process, results, possible hypotheses, ways to merge datasets, and options for embedding into OHM documents (e.g., Top 10 values listed in the Covenant)

##### Analysis:
  - Data across the two prototypes were merged by adding votes across both prototypes, and ranking values in order of the total number of votes received.

##### Results:

- The following top 10 values were identified and written into the [OHM Covenant]([https://github.com/openheartmind/cOHMunity/blob/main/COVENANT.md](https://github.com/openheartmind/cOHMunity/blob/main/COVENANT.md)): Integrity, Consent, Regeneration, Care, Respect, Transparency, Decentralization, Community, Creativity, and Gifting.

##### Reflections: 
- One participant asked about trading in OHMnoms for prizes, supporting the idea that they may incentivise engagement when real rewards are available.

### 4. Discussion
  
This experiment aimed to explore values that are important to the OHM community and its collective mission. We achieved our primary aim: determining a list of priority values for embedding into governance documents. Our secondary aim -- converting these values into evaluation dimensions in WisdOHM -- remains open and dependent on app development. In this section, we will highlight the successes and limitations of the experiment, and provide guidelines for improving future iterations. 

#### 4.1 Diverse Participants 
We witnessed a diverse community come together for the first OHM Council meeting, with participants spanning multiple continents and backgrounds across the sciences, arts, technology, and other sectors of society. This diversity is encouraging for two reasons. First, it validates the broad appeal of the WisdOHM mechanism across different communities and contexts. Second, diverse samples strengthen Wisdom of the Crowd effects, improving the accuracy of collective intelligence systems.

#### 4.2 Participation Patterns
We observed a participation decline across stages (37 → 14 → 13 → 10), reflecting typical engagement patterns in multi-stage governance processes. Each stage required increasing commitment: from passive attendance to active value nomination, pairwise comparisons, and reflective discussion. Since meetings were open, this likely represents different subsets of the community engaging where their interest and availability aligned, rather than a fixed cohort completing all stages.

Future iterations should balance inclusivity with engagement depth, potentially offering multiple participation levels and clearer time commitment expectations upfront. Recognising and rewarding meeting attendance through the WisdOHM system may also help strengthen participation across all stages.

#### 4.3 Collective Valuation and Embedding into Governance Documents
We successfully demonstrated a new use case for WisdOHM: collaborative value-selection within a given community. We received a diverse range of value nominations, reflecting the diversity of our community, and giving rise to a unique set of 25 values for rating by the community. Two prototypes were completed, and the results were averaged to produce an overall ranking across values. The resulting "Top 10" was written into the OHM Covenant, proving both real-world applicability and the feasibility of dynamic, evolving governance documents that reflect community values over time.

#### 4.4 Different Values for Different Subpopulations
Two prototypes were completed, reflecting members of "OHMcore" and the broader "cOHMunity", and proving the concept for permissionless, bottom-up activation of the system. These samples produced different results, demonstrating that we can capture the unique value-sets of different parts of the community, using the same fundamental mechanism. In the future, these different value sets may be used to evaluate different parts of the project, reflecting the values of those teams who are doing the bulk of the work. 

#### 4.5 A Principled Way to Choose Valuation Dimensions
This experiment demonstrated an improvement over our previous approaches to selecting dimensions for the WisdOHM system. Rather than using popularity-based selection—where the most frequently nominated values become evaluation criteria—this method used the participatory nature of WisdOHM itself to prioritise values based on their perceived importance to the mission.

The approach also revealed that different community subgroups prioritise different values, enabling more nuanced evaluation systems. For example, core team contributions might be evaluated using the OHMcore value set (emphasising Care and Decentralisation), while broader community contributions use the cOHMunity values (emphasising Regeneration and Creativity).

For the WisdOHM platform, this creates a framework where specific values identified through this process can serve as "secondary dimensions" alongside universal "primary dimensions" (e.g., Gratitude, Value to Mission, Value to Community) -- found to work well with the Metavaluation process. This allows communities to maintain their unique value emphasis while ensuring interoperability across different projects using the WisdOHM system.

Future applications could use this method to periodically refresh evaluation dimensions as communities evolve, creating truly dynamic governance systems that adapt to changing priorities.

#### 4.6 Direct Rewards for Reviews
Participants earned "OHMnoms" for each pairwise comparison, directly addressing the voter apathy problem common in DAOs and participatory governance systems. While we cannot determine whether rewards motivated participation or participants were simply committed to helping the project, the reward system successfully provided immediate recognition for contributions.

The leaderboard showing comparison counts created visible acknowledgment of participation, while one participant's inquiry about trading OHMnoms for prizes suggested interest in the reward mechanism's potential. However, only two participants provided cryptocurrency wallet addresses for future rewards, indicating either low crypto-literacy or skepticism about future value.

This experiment demonstrates the feasibility of integrating direct rewards into governance processes. Future research could systematically compare engagement rates with and without reward mechanisms to isolate their effects on participation.

#### 4.7 Different Ways to 'Play the Game'
Different strategies became apparent during the rating phase. In particular, some participants completed a large number of reviews in a short period of time -- 'trusting their gut' and responding relatively quickly, whereas other participants took considerably longer to weigh up each option and decide accordingly -- sometimes also adding a qualitative review to explain their decision. This diversity is healthy, as it reflects the diversity of our community in how they approached the problem at hand. 

Our goal at OHM is to recognise and reward all forms of value toward the OHM mission. Although the former strategy is directly valued at this stage (with discrete rewards for each comparison completed), the latter may prove to be even more valuable over time (especially if some value arises from the qualitative reviews). This raises an important point: OHMnoms are *never final* -- because they represent the *perceived* value of contributions toward the OHM mission, and perceptions can change, the number of OHMnoms each contribution receives can also change over time. Practically, we can assess this through by dynamic sampling of past contributions -- shuffling them into the evaluation process periodically to check and update previous valuations. This means that previously under/overvalued contributions may be given a fairer weight when their true value is realised at a later point. It also means that participants should feel free to contribute in the ways that they feel are most valuable, irrespective of the current reward mechanism. Nevertheless, this remains entirely theoretical at this point, and will need to be tested as the project evolves. 

#### 4.8 Implications for community onboarding
The value mapping process revealed individual participants' priorities while building collective understanding. This suggests potential applications for community onboarding: new members could complete abbreviated value prioritisation exercises to help them find aligned subgroups and understand community culture.

Such an approach would serve dual purposes: introducing newcomers to the WisdOHM system while generating data about community composition and value alignment over time.

#### 4.9 Limitations and Future Improvements
This experiment had several methodological limitations that future iterations should address:

**Data processing:** ChatGPT standardisation occurred without nominee consultation, potentially altering intended meanings. Future versions should validate changes with original contributors.

**Sample representation:** Results reflect only active participants (primarily English-speaking, technically capable). Broader community values may differ significantly.

**Statistical power:** Small sample sizes (n=2-13 per stage) prevent robust statistical analysis. Larger studies will be needed to validate patterns.

**Platform limitations**: The spreadsheet prototype hindered evaluation of supporting contributions like meeting attendance and qualitative feedback. The upcoming WisdOHM app should enable more comprehensive reward systems.

### 5. Conclusion
Overall, the Value Mapping experiment was a success. We observed diverse engagement across all sessions, generated an initial impression of our collective values, and embedded this list into the OHM Covenant. We demonstrated a new use case for the Metavaluation framework, which addresses one pain point often found in communities: misalignment between members' values. We learned about how to improve this process for implementation in our upcoming app, prior to the next iteration in a year's time. Thus, the first experiment in our year-long experiment has been largely successful, and set up the foundation for future iteration in coming months. 

Our next experiment in the OHM Council Series will explore participatory governance: using WisdOHM to elect a set of representatives to our charity board, who will serve the project and community throughout the year -- including the values we collectively determined this month. To join, see our [open calendar](https://lu.ma/ohmcollective) for our upcoming meetings.
