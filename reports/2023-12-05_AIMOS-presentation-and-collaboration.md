# AIMOS Conference
On November 23rd, Cooper presented on behalf of OHM at the fifth annual conference of the _Association for Interdisciplinary Meta-research and Open Science_ (AIMOS). This marked our first conference presentation for OHM and the WisdOHM system, including hot-off-the-press Tiny OHM data. The talk was attended by around 20 people and followed with a lively discussion on potential uses for WISDOM in academia (trimmed from the video below due to poor audio). 

### An emerging collaboration
After the conference, the AIMOS president kindly included our contribution nomination form in their follow-up email to all 82 attendees. 22 people responded to this form, including 5 brave souls who elected to join Cooper in a new collaboration using WISDOM to crowd-review contributions to the AIMOS conference itself. This represents the first use case for WISDOM outside of OHM Gatherings, and our first cross-community collaboration. Watch this space!
