# WISDOM v2-2: AIMOS Conference Survey

### Version Notes
This prototype is an evolution of the Tiny OHM Survey, incorporating the following updates:
- removed sensitive info from backend and condensed multiple sheets into a single sheet
- new process to select controlled set of diverse contributions
- dimensions of interest selected by crowd-response

### Where was this version tested?
AIMOS is a meta-science and open science conference that was hosted at QUT in November 2023. Cooper hosted a discussion group at the conference and invited participants to join in a collaboration to review AIMOS contributions (ongoing at April 2024)

## Methods
### Materials
- [Contribution Survey form](https://forms.gle/nyAr8baUuQ23FdUK9) (contact for access to original)
- [WISDOM Survey](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kQJM2kEVulzwXBQZuvR46wxaQY5_ohm0rbndIkdEkSE/edit?usp=sharing) (open access)
- [Project board](https://github.com/orgs/openheartmind/projects/1) (open access)

### Participants
- 22 respondants to Contribution Survey form
- 5 Research team members
- X reviewers (ongoing at April 2024)

### Process
These methods will be presented in chronological order using the WISDOM framework stages of Record, Review, Recognise, Reward, and Respect.

#### 1. Record
AIMOS contributions were recorded by participants who completed the Contribution Survey form (see 'contribution data: raw' tab [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kQJM2kEVulzwXBQZuvR46wxaQY5_ohm0rbndIkdEkSE/edit?usp=sharing)). CS estimated the vaue of each contribution in OHMnoms. CS & AF added tags to each contribution. CS & AF created histograms to show diversity of selected contributions. CS selected a range of contributions, aiming to create a normal distribution of OHMnom estimates and a diverse selection of contributors and tags ((see 'preprocessing' tab [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kQJM2kEVulzwXBQZuvR46wxaQY5_ohm0rbndIkdEkSE/edit?usp=sharing)). 

Respondants could also use the form to nominate values to be reflected in this research project. CS visualised these responses as a [word cloud](https://drive.google.com/open?id=10N0Z2mfRE1JZ8SjMG4CnT_U2Xju_b9VQ&usp=drive_fs) and the research team agreed to use the 5 most common words for evaluating contributions in this study. 

#### 2. Review
Reviewers vote between pairs of contributions on multiple dimensions of interest. For each pair, reviewers also select their username from a dropdown box and have the opportunity to add notes.

##### Regular Reviews (comparing AIMOS contributions to AIMOS contributions)
- 6 comparison questions:
  - 1-5: "Select the contribution that demonstrates more... Generosity / Inclusivity / Transparency /	Integrity /	Creativity"
  - 6: "Overall, which are you more grateful for?"

##### Meta-reviews  (comparing AIMOS contributions to review contributions)
- 1 comparison question: "Overall, which are you more grateful for?"

#### 3. Recognise
TBD

#### 4. Reward
TBD

#### 5. Respect
TBD

#### 6. Receive (included in slides, but new model will merge this with (4) and replace with "Replicate" to highlight the evolving nature instead)
TBD

### Results
TBD

### Learnings
TBD

### Next steps
TBD
