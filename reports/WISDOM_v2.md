# WISDOM v2

### Previous learnings
WISDOM V1 was based on the best-in-class examples of open peer review in the open source and open science spaces (e.g., Open Science Leaders); effectively a multidimensional scorecard with descriptions to guide scoring in each dimension. Although this process works well for homogeneous offerings (e.g., applications to attend a hackathon), it cannot deal with highly heterogenous offerings across very different categories. In the context of OHM Gatherings, we want to compare the relative value of very different contributions (e.g., cleaning toilets vs. playing a DJ set vs. administration tasks). This is difficult to achieve using a rubric, because we cannot capture the full range of value that people might add in a short text format. It would also place a burden of time and expertise on the reviewer (e.g., familiarity with the entire project), which limits participation from the broader crowd. 

### Version 2 description
V2 aims to simplify the problem space for the user by just asking them to compare two contributions on some dimension of interest. This is inspired by a common experimental paradigm called pairwise comparisons -- basically, the participant chooses which of two contributions (A or B) is more X (where X is some dimension of interest). Here, we would present users with two offerings/contributions and ask them to tell us which one they feel is more [valuable / worthy of gratitude / easy to complete / novel / etc.]. The actual questions we ask can be explored empirically, by collecting data and conducting metascience on the outcomes.
