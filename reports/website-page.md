We're developing a generalizable open source framework for recognising and rewarding contributions to the commons, so that we can empower contributors and connect diverse communities with aligned goals. 

At OHM, we're experimenting with new ways to self-organize and recognize valuable contributions to the community. We've tested several models at our events, all radically transparent and based on open science principles. Each of these experiments has served as an opportunity to collect data, test hypotheses and iterate on the model. 

The result is WISDOM, an open source framework for quantifying value, incentivising contributions, and connecting diverse communities with digitally-encoded values. Although WISDOM was prototyped in the context of OHM gatherings, we've since generalized it to academia by peer-reviewing contributions to the AIMOS conference. Watch the video below for a 6 minute lightning talk introduction to WISDOM.
