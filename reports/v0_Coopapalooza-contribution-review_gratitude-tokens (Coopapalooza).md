# WISDOM v0: Gratitude Tokens used to review contributions to Coopapalooza (OHM pilot test)

### Background
Coopapalooza was a gift-based gathering held in November 2021 to pilot test the OHM Gathering concept. After the gathering, all ~120 participants were invited to participate in a review to express gratitude for contributions to the event. In brief, each reviewer was given a pool of tokens based on how long they were at the event and asked to divide them between the event contributions. 

### Materials
- [Participant information sheet (open access)](https://doc.clickup.com/36615879/d/h/12xdp7-62/0ea39f14bc5b86a)
- [Survey Version A (open access)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Gw0ad-vmj8upSXEdeHZLK0JE8MZPralOwEeyQB_h3EY/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Master spreadsheet (restricted access)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tEBpY5dNKp22FzX7kWFUcOPZwXSTGdos5uhQbA-ymk0/edit?usp=sharing)

Two versions of the survey were created:
1. [_Version A_](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Gw0ad-vmj8upSXEdeHZLK0JE8MZPralOwEeyQB_h3EY/edit?usp=sharing) contained a list of 57 contributions that had been pre-identified by core organisers, plus a number of empty rows where reviewers could add more contributions not already listed. 
2. _Version B_ was identical to _Version A_ but without the pre-identified set of contributions (only empty rows). 

Survey versions were pseudo-randomly allocated to reviewers, controlling for (a) time in attendance at the event and (b) degree of involvement with. Note that Version B was not rigorously analysed prior to the data loss (see below) and so is not reported here. 

### Participants
All attendees were contacted via email with a link to the [Participant information sheet (open access)](https://doc.clickup.com/36615879/d/h/12xdp7-62/0ea39f14bc5b86a) and a personalised link to Survey A or Survey B (pseudo-randomised). 30 attendees completed and returned Survey A. 

### Methods

Reviewers under Survey A were given the following instructions:

> Please read the Participant Information Sheet before completing this survey. Only enter information in the blue and green cells. Based on your arrival/departure time, you will be allocated a certain number of Gratitude Tokens (shown at the top of this survey) to be distributed between group and individual contributions in any way you see fit. Please distribute all of your tokens and no more. To award Gratitude Tokens to the 57 contributions we've listed, type the number of tokens in the green box next to the contribution. Please note that each contribution only includes those tasks listed in the dropdown menu -- if you wish to award other tasks not included in the dropdown please allocate those tokens separately. To award tokens to other contributions we haven't listed, please describe the experience / contribution in the blue column, type the number of tokens in the green column, and then use the dropdown boxes to select up to 5 contributors to the experience (don't worry if there were more people involved or you don't remember everyone, as we will follow up to make sure all of the contributors get recognised). Note that you are free to award yourself tokens for your own contributions to the festival experience. All tokens awarded in this survey will be distributed to the individual or team of contributors through a secondary allocation process.

### Results
_The original raw data were lost when the Google Drive account that duplicated the surveys from the Master sheet was deleted. Screenshots of the Survey A raw data have been recovered using the Google Sheets versioning feature and can be found in the OHM Google Drive (/Data/Coopapalooza/Data-Recovery_Coopapalooza-Survey-Master/...). These data contain personal names and so are not provided here, but are available for transcription by trusted parties if required in the future._

### Learnings
Following are the main outcomes and learnings from Survey A:
- Token allocations were highly biased, e.g., one reviewer gave 500 tokens to a single contribution and 1 token to all others. This highlights the risk of gaming and other biases with this model.
- Fair completion of the task requires:
  - (a) Expertise. Token allocation equates to a relative score for all contributions (expressed as a percentage of the total available tokens). Completing this task fairly thus requires a broad understanding of all the different contributions, how they relate to one another, and their relative worth. This burden of expertise means that the current protocol is not inclusive, as there are only a few people who can complete this task fairly while considering all the moving parts.
  - (b) Time. Thinking through all of the contributions and their relative worth takes time. Failing this, most people will use heuristics to allocated tokens. This burden of time means that the current protocol is not inclusive, as it requires a significant commitment to add a meaningful unit of data.
- The user interface required for this type of survey is very intricate and therefore non-inclusive.

### Other learnings
- Backup backup backup.
- Use an organisational account for securing data (now created).
